"I'm trying to integrate ClearFeed with an external ticketing system and create a collection for customer support. Can you guide me through the process, including setting up responders, request channels, and the triage channel?","Sure, I'd be happy to help you with the integration process! Here's a step-by-step guide to integrate ClearFeed with an external ticketing system and create a collection for customer support:

1. **Integrate ClearFeed with your Slack Workspace**: Before you begin, ensure that you have integrated your Slack Workspace with ClearFeed. This integration is crucial for seamless communication and ticket management.

2. **Set Product Edition to ""External""**: Navigate to [Product Editions](https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/product-editions) and set the product edition to ""External."" This setting ensures that ClearFeed is configured for external ticketing.

3. **Create a Collection**:
   - Navigate to [Collections](https://web.clearfeed.app/collections) from the side navigation bar.
   - Click on the `Add new Collection` button on the bottom-left of the page.

4. **Choose Responders**:
   - Select support team members as Responders. You can configure Slack users from specific domains or add additional responders if they are not from a common domain.
   - Check auto-assignment to first-responders `ON` to ensure efficient ticket assignment.

5. **Add Request Channels**:
   - Add the **Request channels** on which you plan to provide support to customers. These channels are where customers will interact with your support team.
   - All public Slack channels can be added from the web app.
   - Private Slack channels can be added by typing `/invite @Clearfeed` on the Slack channels. Note that private channels can only be added after a Collection is created.

6. **Configure Triage Channel**:
   - Add a [**Triage channel** ](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels)for the support team to work from on Slack. This channel is where your support team will manage and respond to tickets.
   - You can select `Create new channel` or `Select existing` option, depending on your preference.

7. **Set Up Ticketing Integration**:
   - Under **Ticketing**, select your external ticketing system (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, etc.) and choose the trigger mode for ticket creation. This integration ensures that tickets created in ClearFeed are synced with your external ticketing system.
   - The trigger mode can be an emoji (e.g., üéüÔ∏è) applied to the thread or tickets can be auto-created on every new message on the request channel.

8. **Edit Workflows (Optional)**:
   - You can edit an existing [workflow](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/workflows) to send a notification to the corresponding triage channel if there is no response to a request for a specified time (e.g., 60 minutes). This is useful for keeping track of unanswered requests.

9. **Set Up Welcome Message (Optional)**:
   - Set up a custom [Welcome message ](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/welcome-messages)for this particular collection to greet customers and provide initial instructions.

Once you have completed these steps, you will have successfully integrated ClearFeed with an external ticketing system and created a collection for managing customer support requests. The bidirectional sync between Slack and the external ticketing system ensures that all interactions and ticket updates are synchronized, providing a seamless support experience for your customers.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific aspects of the integration, feel free to ask!

Can you guide me through the process, including the different settings and options available?","Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide to activating the Virtual Agent and Agent Assistant features on ClearFeed: 

1. **Add and index your knowledge sources**: Before you can use the Virtual Agent or Agent Assistant, you'll need to add your relevant knowledge sources to ClearFeed and ensure they are indexed.

"I'm trying to understand how the ClearFeed Email Ticketing system works. If I send a support request via email, will my message be visible to the entire Slack channel, or is it directed to a specific agent? Also, how do I ensure that my message is not shared with other users?","When you send a support request via email, it is directed to a dedicated Slack channel. This ensures that your message is not visible to the entire Slack workspace but is shared with the relevant support team. 

To maintain privacy, you can configure the triage channel to only show tickets that have been converted from requests. This way, your email request will not be automatically shared with the entire channel. Instead, it will be visible only after an agent converts it into a ticket.

I want to set up ClearFeed for internal support with an integration to Zendesk.

The information in this guide was last updated a month ago.",https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/getting-started/for-internal-support
How can I ensure that my internal team's conversations about a ticket remain private and not visible to the customer?,"To keep your internal team's conversations private and hidden from the customer, you can utilize the internal comments feature on the triage channel. Simply prefix your messages with the üîíemoji to ensure they remain confidential and are not visible to the requestor. This allows your team to collaborate and discuss ticket-related matters without exposing sensitive information to the customer. For more information on using internal comments, refer to this [link](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels/for-internal-helpdesk#using-internal-comments-on-the-triage-channel).

Additionally, if you want to share the ticket with an engineering integration like Jira, GitHub, or Linear, you can use the 'More Actions' feature. This allows you to file tasks or link existing tasks from these external tools, providing better tracking and visibility. Comments from the triage channel thread will be synced with the linked task, ensuring everyone is on the same page. For more details on 'More Actions', check out this [link](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels/for-internal-helpdesk#triage-more-actions).

Remember, the triage channel is a powerful tool for managing tickets and facilitating internal communication. By using internal comments and 'More Actions', you can maintain privacy and efficiently collaborate on ticket-related tasks.",https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels/for-internal-helpdesk

Can you help me understand how to filter requests by assignee, status, and channel using the slash commands?","Sure, I'd be happy to help you with using slash commands to filter requests! Here's a breakdown of the process:

To filter requests by assignee, status, and channel, you can use the following slash command:

```
/cf requests --assignee @[assignee_name] --status=[status] --channel=[channel_name]
```

Here's what each part of the command means:

- `--assignee`: This flag is used to filter requests by the assignee. You can tag the users using the @ symbol. For example, `@Jaynil Pandya` would filter requests assigned to Jaynil Pandya.

- `--status`: This flag is used to filter requests by their status. Allowed values include `open`, `in_progress`, `closed`, and `on_hold`. For instance, `--status=on_hold` would filter requests that are on hold.

- `--channel`: This flag is used to filter requests by the channel they were raised in. You can tag the channels using the # symbol. For example, `#request-sandbox` would filter requests from the 'request-sandbox' channel.

By combining these flags, you can create powerful filters to quickly find the requests you're looking for. For more information on using slash commands, you can refer to the [ClearFeed Help Center](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/product-features/collections).

"I'm considering using ClearFeed for our internal helpdesk, but I'm not sure if it's the right fit. Can you explain the differences between ClearFeed's internal helpdesk and integration products, and how they are priced?","ClearFeed's internal helpdesk is a standalone helpdesk built on Slack, allowing agents to manage their entire workflow and reporting within the platform. It serves as the primary ticketing system, with features to integrate with other ticketing and task management systems. The pricing for this product is based on the number of agents using the platform.

On the other hand, ClearFeed's integration product is a bi-directional integration between Slack and ticketing/engineering systems. In this case, the agent's workflow and reporting are managed in their primary ticketing system, which is generally not ClearFeed. The pricing for this product is based on the number of tickets created through the integration.

If you're looking for a comprehensive helpdesk solution for your internal team, the internal helpdesk product might be a better fit. However, if you already have a primary ticketing system and want to integrate it with Slack, the integration product could be more suitable.",https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/pricing-and-billing/billing

"I'm confused about the billing for ClearFeed's Integrations product edition. Can you explain how the billing works for annual and monthly subscriptions, and how the usage bundle is determined?","Sure, I'd be happy to clarify the billing process for ClearFeed's Integrations product edition. 

**Annual Billing:**
To get the annual discount (e.g., 15%), you need to pay for the upfront purchase of ClearFeed Ticket Packages at the beginning of the contract period. You'll be charged once for a 1-year contract based on your selected plan.

**Monthly Billing:**
With ClearFeed monthly subscriptions, you pre-purchase the capacity to use a certain number of tickets for a given month. You'll be billed for minimum usage (50 tickets) at the start of the contract. At the end of each month, overages are charged based on actual usage, and adjustments are made accordingly. 

**Usage Bundle:**
Usage bundles are designed to offer quantity discounts. As the number of tickets increases, the per-unit pricing for tickets goes down. The most appropriate usage bundle is automatically detected and applied based on your ticket volume, ensuring the lowest pricing for a given ticket volume. 

For more information on ClearFeed's pricing and billing, you can refer to the [Integrations](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/getting-started/readme) documentation.",https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/pricing-and-billing/billing/integrations
