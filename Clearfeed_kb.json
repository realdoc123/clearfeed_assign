The 3\ndifferent product editions have different\n[pricing](https://clearfeed.ai/pricing) models.\n\nOne ClearFeed Account (Parent or Child Account) can be integrated with only\none Slack or Teams workspace. Integrations with Zendesk and other\nticketing/issue management systems can be shared between 2 ClearFeed Accounts.\n\nIf you have 2 different accounts (one parent and one child) with different\nproduct editions, you will receive 2 different invoices from ClearFeed.\n\nEach ClearFeed account (Parent or Child Account) has its own set of users for\nadmins to maintain data access and privacy.\n\n##\n\nUsecase\n\nCreating a child account is advisable in the following scenarios:\n\n  * Integrate ClearFeed with multiple Slack workspaces\n\n  * Integrated ClearFeed with Slack and MS Teams workspaces\n\n  * Integrate multiple domains from your ticketing system into the same Slack workspace.\n\n  * Currently using ClearFeed as an External Helpdesk, and want to start using ClearFeed as an Internal Helpdesk (and vice-versa). \n\n  * Currently using ClearFeed as an Internal Helpdesk, and want to start using ClearFeed for Integrations (and vice-versa). \n\n  * For internal helpdesk support - creating multiple accounts can be helpful to isolate work across different teams if you don't want tickets on one account to be visible to users from another account.\n\nTo create additional ClearFeed accounts, **you need to be an Admin in the\nprimary account. This is mandatory.**\n\n##\n\nCreate child accounts\n\n  1. Navigate to your profile icon at the bottom-left corner\n\n  2. Click on `Create New Account`.\n\n  3. Enter a name for the new account.\n\n  4. Choose the required sharing option for this account:\n\n     * **Share Slack workspace with your account:** This allows you to connect with other ticketing integrations into the same Slack workspace (e.g. connect multiple Zendesk domains with this approach). \n\n     * **Share other integrations with your account:** Connect this account with a new Slack workspace but share the ticketing integrations with the primary account. \n\n       * E.g.: Connect different Slack workspaces with the same Intercom domain using this approach. \n\n     * **Share Slack workspace and all supported integrations with your account** : Connect your new account with the**** same Slack workspace and share the ticketing integrations with the primary account. \n\n       * E.g.: Connect existing Slack workspaces with the same Intercom domain using this approach. \n\n  5. Select [Product Edition](/clearfeed-help-center/account-settings/product-editions) for the child account setup \n\n###\n\nSwitch Accounts\n\nOnce you have created additional accounts, you can switch between the accounts\nby simply hovering over the profile icon (bottom-left corner) and you will\nnotice all the accounts. From there, click on the account you want to switch\nto and you'll be redirected to that account.\n\n##\n\nRename Accounts\n\nYou can rename your account name at any time on ClearFeed.\n\n##\n\nSharing Options\n\n###\n\n**Slack workspace**\n\n  * Connect your new ClearFeed account to the same Slack workspace as your primary account, sharing channels and conversations for seamless collaboration.\n\n  * Maintain independent integrations for your new account, separate from those of your primary account.\n\n  * Set unique SLA policies, business hours, users, and collections for your new account.\n\n###\n\nOther integrations\n\nOnly Zendesk, Intercom, and Atlassian are supported as shared integrations as\nof now. If you want to request support for additional integrations, please\nreach out to us via Slack or at support@clearfeed.ai.\n\n  * Create a new ClearFeed account to connect with a different Slack workspace sharing the same email domain as your primary account.\n\n  * Share integrations between your primary ClearFeed account and the new account across multiple Slack workspaces.\n\n  * Use the same integrations connected to your primary account across various Slack workspaces.\n\n  * The new account can set its own SLA policy, business hours, users, and collections.\n\n**Note** :\n\n  1. If an integration is shared, the child account cannot reconnect or delete it.\n\n  2. However, users are allowed to independently connect any other (non-shared) integration to a child account .\n\n  3. If any new ticketing integration is configured as shared, behavior #2 will apply.\n\n###\n\n**Slack workspace & **other integrations\n\nOnly Zendesk, Intercom, and Atlassian are supported as shared integrations as\nof now. If you want to request support for additional integrations, please\nreach out to us via Slack or at support@clearfeed.ai.\n\n  * By selecting this option, your new account will be linked to the same Slack workspace and use the same integrations as your primary account. \n\n  * Since multiple teams use Zendesk ticketing and forms, creating a child account with this configuration allows users to customize screen options for forms. For example, some teams might want to hide the \"Solve\" button, while others prefer to remove the \"View Form\" button.\n\n**Note** :\n\n  1. If an integration is shared, the child account cannot reconnect or delete it.\n\n  2.

If any new ticketing integration is configured as shared, behavior #2 will apply.\n\n##\n\nRelationship with Primary Account\n\n###\n\nDependent\n\n  * The whitelisted bots are shared between primary and secondary account(s). That means, that when a new account is created, it carries forward the whitelisted bot configuration from the primary account. Any change in this configuration from any of the accounts (primary or secondary) will be reflected across all accounts.\n\n  * Whitelisted domains allow users from a list of domains to join the ClearFeed Account automatically. Only the admin user\u2019s email domain is copied over to the child account. Any other whitelisted domains are not copied. Gmail is an exception and is never copied, even for admins. To whitelist more domains, users need to manually add them to the child accounts.\n\n  * If you choose to **share the integrations** and connect the new account to a different Slack workspace, then the integrations will be dependent on the primary account. You will be unable to reconnect or delete them from the new account.\n\n###\n\nIndependent\n\n  * Account-level settings such as SLAs, business hours, data retention, and user management are independent of the new account(s).\n\n  * Collection and channel management settings are independent and isolated for the new account.\n\n  * [Objects](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/objects-fields-and-forms) (forms and fields), [Announcements](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/announcements) and [Knowledge Sources](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/automated-answers) are independent and isolated for the new account.\n\n[PreviousCustomer Portal](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/customer-\nportal)[NextLogin Methods](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/security-\nsettings)\n\nLast updated 18 days ago\n\n"

Can we connect to a different Zendesk instance by clicking \"reconnect\"\nfrom the integrations page?\n\nAns: No - clicking on `Reconnect` will only allow users to connect with the\nsame Zendesk instance. Clicking on the `Disconnect` button would however allow\nyou to remove the current integration and connect to another Zendesk domain.\n\nIf you want to use multiple Zendesk instances shared with the same Slack\nworkspace, you can create a child account to connect with another Zendesk\ndomain. Learn how to do that [**here**](/clearfeed-help-center/account-\nsetup/multiple-clearfeed-accounts).\n\n####\n\n2\\. Can we connect to a different Zendesk instance on the same ClearFeed\naccount?\n\nAns: Yes - you can visit the [Integrations\npage](https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/integrations) and click on\n`Disconnect` beside the Zendesk integration to remove the current integration.\n\nOnce it is disconnected - click on `Connect` to start a fresh integration with\na different Zendesk domain.\n\n####\n\n3\\. How does ClearFeed map users between Slack and the integrated external\nticketing system?\n\nAns: The mapping of users between ClearFeed and the ticketing system depends\non the integration. Below - you'll find the details for every integration.\n\nIntegration| Mapping for Ticket Creation| Mapping for Replies  \n---|---|---  \n**Zendesk**|  We'll check if the requester's email already has a Zendesk\nprofile. If it does, we'll use their profile information to create a ticket.\nOtherwise, we'll create a ticket using just their email address for both name\nand email.| We'll try to find the commenter's Zendesk profile by email. If\nfound, we'll use their ID to post a comment. Otherwise, we'll create a new\nend-user profile with their Slack details and use that ID to comment. (We\nwon't create profiles with missing emails.)  \n**Jira**|  If the Jira project lets us set the reporter, we look for the\nrequester's profile by email and set them as the reporter if found. Otherwise,\nif we can't find the profile or can't set the reporter for the project, the\nreporter becomes the ClearFeed bot.| We search for the message author's email\nin Atlassian. If we find them and they have permission, we post the comment on\nthe Jira ticket as them. If we can't find their profile, either because the\nemail is missing on Slack or there's no corresponding profile in Atlassian, or\nthey don't have permission, we post the comment as ClearFeed with the header\n\"Sent by Username on Slack\".  \n**Freshdesk**|  We use the requester's email to create the ticket. The ticket\nappears as if it was made by the person who connected Freshdesk with\nClearFeed, but it's reported by the person whose email and name we send to the\nAPI.| We search for the email in Freshdesk. If it's an agent's, we post the\ncomment under their name. If it's a customer's and we can assume their\nidentity, we post under their name. If we can't find a match, we create a new\ncontact and post the comment under their name. If posting fails, it's done\nunder the authorizing agent's name.  \n**Salesforce**|  We'll check the requester's email in Salesforce. If it's an\nagent (user), we'll ask for their email. If it's a customer (contact), we'll\nuse it to create a case. Otherwise, we'll create a new contact and use that\nfor the case.| Try to find a Salesforce User (customer) against this email. If\nfound then post the comment as that user. If not found then post the message\nas an email message against this ticket.  \n**Intercom**|  We'll check the message author's email in Intercom. If it's an\nagent's profile, we'll raise an error (agents can't have tickets filed for\nthem). Otherwise, we'll use the contact profile (existing or new) to file the\nticket. We prioritize contact look up first.| Try to find contact/agent's\nprofile in intercom. If found use that to post the comment and If no profile\nis found then we create a new intercom contact against this email and post the\ncomment using this profile  \n**HubSpot**|  We'll find the customer's HubSpot contact. If they exist, we'll\nlink them to a new ticket. Otherwise, we'll create a new contact and link them\nto the ticket we file.| We check if the email matches an agent's profile. If\nyes, we send it as an email from an agent. If not, we treat it as an incoming\nemail from a contact. Then, we post the comment as an email against the ticket\nusing the message author's email.  \n**Linear**|  We will use the name and the avatar of the Slack user directly to\nfile the Linear tickets| Similar to filing tickets - we will use the name and\navatar of the user from Slack. We don't need to create a new user profiles to\npost comments on Linear  \n**GitHub**|  Github issues are always filed on behalf of ClearFeed.| Comments\nare always posted as ClearFeed bot  \n**JSM**|  When posting comments on JSM, we first check if the message author's\nemail is present. If it is, we see if there's a matching Atlassian user. If\nfound, we use their profile to raise the request. If no Atlassian user\nmatches, we create a customer profile with the email and name provided. Then,\nwe check if the user has permission to raise the request for that customer. If\nall else fails, we file the ticket with ClearFeed as the requester.| We search\nfor the message author's email in Atlassian. If we find them and they have\npermission, we post the comment on the JSM ticket as them. If we can't find\ntheir profile, either because the email is missing on Slack or there's no\ncorresponding profile in Atlassian, or they don't have permission, we post the\ncomment as ClearFeed with the header \"Sent by Username on Slack\".  \n  \n[PreviousGitHub](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/github)[NextWhitelabel\nClearFeed](/clearfeed-help-center/account-settings/white-label-clearfeed-app)\n\nLast updated 1 month ago\n\n"

Set up a new Collection by following steps 1 to 5 mentioned in [Creating a Collection](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/product-features/collections#creating-a-collection).\n\n  2. Once you have done the above - you can:\n\n    1. Select the `Create new channel` option. Selecting this will let ClearFeed create a new triage channel in your workspace.\n\n    2. If you do not want to create a new triage channel, you can select an existing channel instead via `Select existing` option.\n\nA Collection can only have one assigned Triage channel. However, one Triage\nchannel can be linked to many Collections.\n\n###\n\nConfiguring from Slack\n\n  1. Go to the channel you want to configure as triage.\n\n  2. Run /invite @Clearfeed and select `Setup as Triage Channel`.\n\n  3. Select the `Collection` for which you want to associate this triage.\n\nIn the Select Collection dropdown, you will only see the Collections that do\nnot have a triage linked to them.\n\n###\n\nFrom Triage Settings\n\n  1. Head over to [Triage Settings](https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/triage)\n\n  2. Create a Slack channel using `Create new channel` and add a name to the triage channel.\n\n     * Select an existing Slack channel to convert to a triage channel. This works for public channels and private channels with the ClearFeed bot.\n\n  3. Select the [Triage mode](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/setup-triage-channel#triage-mode) which determines if all requests flow into the triage channel or only tickets.\n\n  4. Optionally, enable notifications on the triage channel to help responders gain visibility into _Open_ and _Unsolved_ Requests\n\n##\n\nTriage Settings\n\nExplore the settings on [Triage\nsettings](https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/triage). By clicking on the\n`Edit` button - you can modify the properties of a particular triage channel.\n\nThe `Active` label is added to any triage channel that has been connected to\nat least one collection.\n\n###\n\nTriage Mode\n\nTriage modes allow you to choose which requests you want to be managed via the\ntriage channel.\n\n**All Requests Mode -** In this mode, all messages that are classified as\nrequests by ClearFeed will be shown on the Triage Channel.\n\n**Only Tickets Mode -** In this mode, only requests on the request channel\nthat have been converted to tickets via Emoji action or automatic ticketing\nwill be visible on the Triage channel.\n\nFor Internal Helpdesk product edition - triage mode is set to _Only Tickets_\nby default.\n\nWhen the modes are changed, only new requests will switch over to the new\nbehavior.\n\n###\n\nComment Visibility\n\nComment visibility controls what replies from your team's discussions on the\ntriage channel are visible to the requestor.\n\n  * **Public:** All comments from the triage channel will be synced to the request channel except for those prefixed with a (\ud83d\udd12) emoji (these comments will remain internal to triage).\n\n  * **Private:** No comments from the triage channel will be synced to the request channel except those prefixed with a (\ud83d\udce2) emoji.\n\n###\n\nDisable Tagging\n\nEnable this to stop users from being tagged in triage channels. This helps\nprevent duplicate notifications when you're tagged in request channels.\n\n###\n\nPrivate Messages to Tickets\n\nUse the \ud83d\udd12emoji at the start of a message to make it private. By default, these\nstay within Slack. If this setting is toggled on, private messages are added\nas internal comments to the linked ticket.\n\nNote: Currently, only **Freshdesk and Zendesk** are supported. Private\nmessages are pushed as _**private notes**_ on Freshdesk and _**internal\ncomments**_ on Zendesk.\n\n####\n\n**Sync mode**\n\nChoose whether all internal (\ud83d\udd12) comments from ClearFeed are synced to the\nticketing system or only selected ones.\n\nHere's a look at how the private messages from Slack are synced to the\nticketing system:\n\n###\n\nNotifications\n\nTriage notifications remind responders about Open and Unsolved items,\nhighlighting those with _High_ priority. ClearFeed sends two different\ndigests:\n\n  1. **Daily Digest**\n\n     * Notify daily for Requests that are 'Open' and need a response.\n\n  2. **Weekly Digest**\n\n     * Notify every Monday for unsolved Requests from the last month until the most recent week.\n\n####\n\n**Learn how to use the Triage channel based on your ClearFeed product\nedition:**\n\n  1.

Once this change is made, users would need to prefix\nmessages with \ud83d\udce2 emoji to have them flow into customer channels.\n\n  1. **Does renaming the triage channel take effect in the ClearFeed Web App?**\n\nAns:**** Yes, shortly after updating the name, it should start showing up on\nthe dashboard. One thing to note here is that the renaming should be done by a\nSlack Workspace Admin.\n\n  1. **Can we edit any message and put the \ud83d\udd12emoji to make it visible internally?**\n\nAns: No, once a message is sent in a thread, it will be public. Editing the\nmessage by placing \ud83d\udd12emoji post sending will not make it internal/private.\n\n"

        "text": "# External Helpdesk\n\n  1. **What is the billing unit for External Helpdesks?**\n\nThe pricing for the External Helpdesk product is based on the total number of\nSlack Connect channels to which you add ClearFeed.\n\n  1. **Does pricing depend on the number of members of the triage channel?**\n\nNo, you can add any number of members to the triage channel on ClearFeed. You\nonly need to pay for the number of Slack connect channels to which ClearFeed\nis added.\n\n  1. **Does pricing depend on the number of members who have access to the web application?**\n\nNo, you can add any number of members to the ClearFeed web application.\n\n  1. **Will I be billed based on the number of requests/tickets?**\n\nNo, you will not be billed based on the number of tickets for the External\nHelpdesk product. There are no restrictions on the number of tickets.\n\n  1. **How do you calculate the total number of Slack Connect channels for a given month?**\n\nFor a given month, we determine this by looking at the maximum number of Slack\nChannels to which ClearFeed is added on any given date in the month.\n\n  1. **What type of billing plans does ClearFeed support?**\n\nWe support both monthly billing plans as well as annual billing for upfront\npurchases at a discount (15%). The pricing for the professional plan is shared\non the[ website](https://clearfeed.ai/pricing). For the enterprise package,\nyou should write to sales@clearfeed.ai or set up a demo on the website.\n\nAdditionally, if you are a small business, we offer you a 40% discount.\n\n  1. **What is a small business?**\n\nOur small business discount is available for small businesses and startups. To\nbe eligible for a small business discount, companies need to fulfill the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n  * Less than 20 employees\n\n  * Raised less than $5 million in venture funding\n\nIf you are not sure whether you qualify for a small business discount - please\nreach out to us at [sales@clearfeed.ai](mailto:sales@clearfeed.ai)\n\n  1. **What are channel bundles or clearfeed units and how do they determine pricing?**\n\nOur pricing works in bundles of 10 Slack channels. This bundle of 10 Slach\nChannels is called 1 ClearFeed Unit. The usage of ClearFeed units is\ndetermined by the highest number of monitored Slack channels during any given\npoint in the billing month.\n\nFor example, if the Customer starts with 40 monitored channels, increases to\n57 channels in the middle of the month, and ends with 50 monitored channels,\nthe company will be charged for 6 ClearFeed units or 57 Slack channels.\n\n  1. **How does ClearFeed do annual billing?**\n\nTo avail of the annual discount (e.g., 15%), you must pay for the upfront\npurchase of a certain number of ClearFeed Units or a channel bundle. You will\nbe charged once for a contract duration of 1 year based on your selected plan.\n\n  1. **How are monthly overages calculated for the annual plan?**\n\nIf you have signed up for the annual package, then we will bill you for the\nexcess usage at the end of the month. For example, if you have purchased 3\nClearFeed Units (30 Slack channels) in the annual package, but use 35 Slack\nchannels in a given month, an overage fee for 1 additional ClearFeed unit will\nbe charged at the end of that month. The charges for the overage fee will not\nhave any applicable discount applied to the annual plan.\n\n  1. **How does ClearFeed charge for a monthly plan?**\n\nIf you have signed up for monthly payments only, then you'll need to pay for\nthe projected usage for the next month upfront. You will be billed for a month\nassuming that your usage will remain the same as the previous month. If the\nactual usage exceeds or falls short of the projected usage, the charges will\nbe adjusted in the next billing cycle based on the difference in usage.\n\nLet's say the usage during the billing cycle from 21st Feb to 20th Mar is 70\nchannels. At the start of the next billing period from 21st Mar to 20th Apr,\nyou will be charged an overage fee based on the 70 channels used. If the\nactual usage between 21st Mar and 20th Apr is only 50 channels, the overage\nfee for the 20 channels will be refunded and adjusted in the bill for the next\nbilling cycle beginning from 21st Apr. Conversely, if the actual usage is 100\nchannels, the overage fee for an additional 30 channels will be charged in the\nbill for the next billing cycle.\n\n  1. **Will there be adjustments provided if the total usage is less than the lowest slab?**\n\nThe minimal service fee applicable will be based on the lowest slab (typically\n20 channels) or your annual capacity purchased. If you use less than that,\nthere will be no adjustments provided in the next month based on the same. The\nadjustments only apply for the usage of more than the minimal slab defined in\nthe service order form.\n\n  1. **How is a billing month considered?**\n\nIf you start on the paid plan of ClearFeed on 31st March, then the first\nbilling month is considered from 1st April to 30th April. Subsequent billing\nmonths are considered in increments of calendar months.\n\n  1. **What if I want to cancel the plan in the middle of a billing cycle?**\n\nThis is only possible to do for the monthly subscription plan. If you\nunsubscribe in the middle of the month, we will adjust your billing at the end\nof the monthly calendar cycle for that month and make the adjustment based on\nthe actual usage of that month. If there are any applicable rebates, we will\nreimburse them to your credit card.\n\n[PreviousBilling](/clearfeed-help-center/pricing-and-\nbilling/billing)[NextInternal Helpdesk](/clearfeed-help-center/pricing-and-\nbilling/billing/internal-helpdesk)\n\nLast updated 7 months ago\n\n"

If you require support for other integrations, contact us via\nSlack or at support@clearfeed.ai.\n\n**Key functionalities of the triage channel for integrations**\n\n  * Serves as a single source of truth for consolidating tickets created using different methods.\n\n  * Internal teams can respond from the triage channel - the replies get synced to the original ticket thread on Slack and also to the ticketing system. \n\n  * Zendesk and Freshdesk ticket properties can also be modified directly using the triage channel. \n\n  * Internal comments can get posted as internal notes/private notes on Zendesk/Freshdesk. \n\n###\n\nExternal Ticket Management\n\nWhenever a Zendesk/Freshdesk ticket is created - it is directed to the Triage\nchannel of the respective Collection as shown below.\n\n  * Replies from the triage channel are synced to the external ticket and vice-versa. \n\n  * The Zendesk/Freshdesk ticket ID and URL are visible on the triage channel block for easy access.\n\n  * The `Edit Zendesk/Freshdesk Ticket` button lets you manage the external ticket properties defined in the Form's Edit Ticket section used to create the ticket.\n\n    * Read more about managing the edit ticket form: for [Zendesk ticketing](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/zendesk/forms#edit-form), for [Freshdesk ticketing](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/freshdesk/forms#configure-the-zendesk-edit-action-form).\n\n  *     * Optionally, you can also send these internal comments to Zendesk (as internal notes) and Freshdesk (as private notes).\n\n    * Learn how to enable this setting [here](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels/for-integrations#internal-comments). \n\n  * `Mark ticket as Solved` button allows users to resolve the external ticket. \n\n  * `View Form` button lets responders view the form filled out by requestors when creating a ticket.\n\n###\n\nTriage Channel properties\n\n###\n\nInternal Comments\n\nUsing Internal comments from triage channel in Integrations Product Edition\n\n  *   *   * You can also share these internal comments as private notes to the external ticketing system as shown below.\n\n###\n\nAuto-assignment on Zendesk\n\nIf a request is auto-assigned to an agent on ClearFeed, its corresponding\nticket will be assigned to the same agent on Zendesk, assuming they have an\nadmin/agent account there.\n\n**Note:**\n\n  1. [Auto-Assign](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/assignment-rules#auto-assignment-to-first-responder) must be enabled in the relevant Collection.\n\n  2. If the ticket is already assigned to some agent on Zendesk, this will not work.\n\n"

It must be manually created.\n\n  2. **One Token Per User** : At any given point in time, only one token is available per user.\n\n  3. **Deletion and Regeneration** : If there are concerns about security or if a token is misplaced, it can be deleted and a new one can be generated.\n\n###\n\nCreate Token\n\nGo to the [Developer Settings](https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/developer-\nsettings) page and click on Generate Token to create a new token.\n\n###\n\nUse Token\n\nWhen making API calls to ClearFeed, include the token in the `Authorization`\nheader of your request:\n\nCopy\n\n    \n    \n    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\n\nReplace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token you generated.\n\n###\n\nDelete & Re-generateToken\n\nIf you ever feel your token has been compromised, or you want to generate a\nnew one:\n\n  1. Go to [Developer Settings](https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/developer-settings) page.\n\n  2. Click on the delete icon against the existing token.\n\n  3. Generate a new one if required.\n\n**Never Share** : Treat your personal access token like a password. Do not\nshare it, expose it in client-side code, or store it in insecure locations.\nFor added security, consider periodically deleting and regenerating your\ntoken.\n\n##\n\nSigning Secret\n\nThe Signing Secret is a security feature that enables you to verify the\nauthenticity of incoming requests from ClearFeed. When you enable this\nsetting, ClearFeed will sign each outgoing request with a unique signature\nusing this secret. To ensure the integrity of the data received, you can\nverify the signature on your end.\n\n**How to use the Signing Secret:**\n\nEvery request ClearFeed sends to your endpoint contains a signature. This\nsignature has to be validated to ensure the request actually originated from\nClearFeed.\n\n**Important Note:** Keep your Signing Secret confidential and do not share it\nwith unauthorized parties.\n\n##\n\nValidating Requests\n\nTo validate that a request originated from ClearFeed, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Grab your webook secret from the [Developer Settings](https://staging.aws.clearfeed.app/settings/developer-settings) Page.\n\n  2. Extract the verb, URL, body and timestamp from the request. The timestamp to use here is the `X-CF-Timestamp` header. Concatenate all of these and hash them using the webhook secret obtained above.\n\n  3. Compare the resulting signature with the signature in the request.\n\nHere's how it can be done using JavaScript:\n\nCopy\n\n    \n    \n    function verifySignature(signingSecret, verb, url, body, timestamp, signature) {\n      if (Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - timestamp > 60 * 5) {\n        // The request timestamp is more than five minutes from local time.\n        // It could be a replay attack, so let's ignore it.\n        return;\n      }\n      const message = verb + url + body + timestamp;\n      const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', webhookSecret);\n      const calculatedSignature = hmac.update(message).digest('hex');\n      return signature === calculatedSignature;\n    }\n\n##\n\nEvent API Subscription\n\nThe Events API Subscription allows you to subscribe to various types of events\nfrom ClearFeed. Whenever an event of the selected type occurs, ClearFeed will\nsend a POST request to the URL you specify in this setting.\n\n###\n\nSubscribing to Events\n\n  1. Go to the [Developer Settings](https://staging.aws.clearfeed.app/settings/developer-settings) page and find the \"Events API Subscription\" section.\n\n  2. Enter the URL of your server or application endpoint where you want to receive the events.\n\n  3. Click the \"Save\" button to save your subscription preferences.\n\n###\n\nEndpoint Requirements\n\nBefore saving the Events API Subscription endpoint, please ensure the\nfollowing:\n\n  1. The URL must start with `https`.\n\n  2. The endpoint should respond with an HTTP status code of `200` to confirm successful receipt of a test ping. Returning anything other than `200` will not allow you to save the endpoint.\n\n###\n\nReceiving Events\n\nWhen an event occurs, ClearFeed will send a POST request to the specified URL\nwith relevant event data. The payload of the POST request will contain\ninformation about the event, allowing you to take appropriate actions on your\nend.\n\n###\n\nEvent Headers\n\nThe following headers are sent with every request:\n\nCopy\n\n    \n    \n    {\n      'X-CF-Signature': signature,\n      'X-CF-Timestamp': timestamp,\n      'X-CF-Retry-Count': number\n    }\n\nThe `X-CF-Timestamp` header indicates the UNIX timestamp at which the event\noccurred in ClearFeed. The `X-CF-Retry-Count` header indicates the number of\ntimes ClearFeed tried to deliver the event. The value ranges from 0 to 3.\n\n###\n\nSupported Events\n\nRequest Created\n\nCopy\n\n    \n    \n    {\n      \"id\": \"f86719a97f3c9e4b4d03c47b5a95b01d\",\n      \"type\": \"request\",\n      \"sub_type\": \"created\",\n      \"source\": \"slack_event\",\n      \"request\": {\n        \"id\": 352,\n        \"state\": \"Pending\",\n        \"title\": \"Urgent: Payment Issue\",\n        \"channel_id\": \"CHJ34K2L0PE\",\n        \"collection_id\": 11,\n        \"priority\": \"urgent\",\n        \"request_thread\": {\n          \"channel_id\": \"CHJ34K2L0PE\",\n          \"team_id\": \"T0987ABCD23\",\n          \"thread_ts\": \"1793901532.775815\"\n        },\n        \"triage_thread\": {\n          \"channel_id\": \"CHJ34K2L0PE\",\n          \"team_id\": \"T0987ABCD23\",\n          \"thread_ts\": \"1793901540.119234\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"event\": {\n        \"type\": \"message\",\n        \"visibility\": \"public\",\n        \"source\": \"support_channel\",\n        \"request_channel\": {\n          \"channel_id\": \"CHJ34K2L0PE\",\n          \"team_id\": \"T0987ABCD23\",\n          \"text\": \"Hey team, we have an urgent issue.

Ensure your relevant Knowledge Sources are added and [indexed](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/indexing-knowledge-sources) in the ClearFeed web app.\n\n  2. Navigate to Collections Settings for the desired Collection, and scroll to the **Answers** section to enable it.\n\n  3. In `Answers` select either the `Virtual Agent` or the `Agent Assistant` based on your needs.\n\n     * Note that you cannot enable both for a single collection.\n\n  4. **Response Mode** : Choose between **AI-generated answers** , **Search Results** , or **Both**. \n\n     * You can also set the number of search results to display when the Agent responds.\n\n  5. Link this Collection with the required Knowledge Sources by choosing the appropriate tags. \n\n     * At least one Knowledge Source **must** be associated with generating answers.\n\n  6. **Trigger mode**(Only available for Virtual Agent)**:**\n\n    1. **Manual:** Respond with a generated answer only when an emoji (\ud83d\udd0d) is applied to the thread. (Note: Manual mode does not work with automatic ticketing).\n\n    2. **Automatic:** Generate an answer for all requests on a thread.\n\n  7. **Bot Interactions:** Tagging the ClearFeed bot in the thread to get GPT-Powered Answers and search results based on the conversation and knowledge sources.\n\n     * Learn more about Bot Interactions [here](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/bot-interactions). \n\n  8. Finalize and **save** your settings to activate `Answers` across all request channels in this Collection.\n\n##\n\nUsing the Virtual Agent on Slack\n\n###\n\nGenerating Answers for ClearFeed Requests\n\n  1. A request received on the channel prompts the Virtual Agent to search indexed Knowledge Sources for relevant information.\n\n  2. _Virtual Agent_ responds to the request. Based on the **Virtual Agent Response** setting, the bot will share the Generated Answer, Search Results, or both. \n\n  3. A feedback question is present at the footer of the posted answer.\n\n     * If the answer is**helpful,** users****(requesters/responders)**** can click on the `Yes, mark as solved` button and **Solve** the request.\n\n     * Else, if users **do not** find the answer **helpful,** they should click on the `No` button. This marks the answer as _not helpful_ and keeps the request **Open.**\n\n###\n\nUsing Virtual Agent with Ticketing\n\n**Note:** Interaction with the Virtual Agent is different when ticketing is\nset to automatic and manual respectively. This is applicable for both\nClearFeed and External Ticketing.\n\n####\n\nUsing Virtual Agent with Automatic Ticketing enabled\n\n  1. A message on Slack the channel prompts the Virtual Agent to search indexed Knowledge Sources for relevant information.\n\n  2. _Virtual Agent_ responds to the request. Based on the **Virtual Agent Response** setting, the bot will share the Generated Answer, Search Results, or both. \n\n  3. If the**Answer is generated successfully:**\n\n     * Users can give feedback using `Yes, mark as solved` & `No,create a ticket` button.\n\n     * `Yes, mark as solved` button solves the request.\n\n     * `No, create a ticket` button will collapse the answer and initiate the ticket creation process for the user**.**\n\n  4. If the **Virtual Agent does not generate an answer:**\n\n     * Ticket creation will be triggered automatically for the request.\n\n  5. If the **Answer is generated successfully, but the user does not provide feedback:**\n\n     * Ticket creation will be triggered automatically if no feedback is provided by a user for **1 hour.**\n\n####\n\nUsing Virtual Agent with Manual Ticketing enabled\n\n  1. The Virtual Agent is triggered immediately upon receiving a message on the request channel.\n\n  2. Regardless of whether the user clicks \"Yes, mark as Solved\" or \"No\" in the feedback, a ticket will be created when the user reacts with the designated emoji for manual ticketing.\n\n##\n\nUsing the Agent Assistant on the Triage channel\n\n  1. Upon receiving a triage channel request, the Agent Assistant:\n\n    1. Searches indexed sources for snippets. \n\n    2. Uses GPT for answers from relevant snippets. \n\n    3. Posts the generated answer as an internal comment on the request's triage thread.\n\n  2. If the agent approves the answer, they can share it as the response to the request.\n\n  3. If the _Agent Assistant_ is unable to find a relevant answer to the request, it will post a message indicating No relevant answers were found. \n\n  4. **Accessing Search Results:**\n\n     * If the provided answer isn't helpful, click \"See more results\" to open a modal with all other search results from ClearFeed. Use the results to draft responses or share the URL with requesters.\n\n     * **Generating Answers** : If a search result is relevant, click 'Generate Answer' to create a GPT response. If satisfied, share it.\n\n  5. **Using The Answers Button:**\n\n     * You can manually trigger the Agent Assistant and search for answers using the `Answers` button.\n\n##\n\nFAQs\n\n  1. **How can I modify the time window for triggering ticket creation if no feedback is provided?**\n\n**Answer:** If the answer is generated successfully but no feedback is\nprovided by a user within 1 hour, ticket creation is triggered automatically.\nIf you need to modify this 1-hour time window, please reach out to our\ndedicated support team at support@clearfeed.ai for assistance.\n\n  1. **What happens if a request is solved, converted into a ticket, or marked as \"Not a request\" before the answer is generated?**\n\n**Answer:** If the request is solved, converted into a ticket, or marked as\n\"Not a request\" before the answer is generated, the Virtual Agent will not\npost the answer at all.\n\n  1. **What happens to feedback buttons if a request status changes after an answer is generated?**\n\n**Answer:** If the request is solved, converted into a ticket, or marked as\n\"Not a request\" after the answer is generated, the feedback buttons will be\nremoved from the generated answer.\n\n[PreviousManaging & Testing](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/managing-\nknowledge-sources)[NextBot Interactions](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/bot-\ninteractions)\n\nLast updated 2 months ago\n\n"

We will always use the latest set of users when assigning\nrequests.\n\n  1. **If users are marked as unavailable on Slack, how are requests assigned on Round Robin Assignment?**\n\n**Ans:** If a user is marked as unavailable on Slack, the request is assigned\nto the next available responder who is part of the Slack Group.\n\n  1. What happens if a Slack Group and its members change? \n\n**Ans:** If a Slack Group is renamed or if its members are modified, we honor\nthe new group members.\n\n"

There are still\nfeatures supported within this helpdesk to support integrations with a few\nticketing and task management systems to link/file part of the clearfeed\ntickets to other downstream systems. ClearFeed\u2019s integration product is used\nas a bi-directional integration between Slack and ticketing/engineering\nsystems. In this case, the agent's end-to-end workflow and reporting are\nmanaged in their primary ticketing system which is generally not ClearFeed,\nand ClearFeed is used as a bi-directional integration between Slack and the\nticketing system.\n\n  1. **Does ClearFeed offer ClearFeed Integration products in Slack-connect channels?**\n\nWe don\u2019t currently offer ClearFeed integrations as a stand-alone product for\nSlack Connect channels.

These fields provide a quick and efficient\nway for support teams to filter and prioritize tickets.\n\n##\n\nAuto-Categories\n\nClearFeed uses AI to automatically categorize tickets into the following\ncategories:\n\n  1. **Feature Requests** : Requests for new product features or enhancements to existing features.\n\n  2. **Bug** : Issues where the user reports a malfunction or error in the product.\n\n  3. **How to Question** : General queries from users on how to use the product or specific features.\n\n  4. **Problem Report** : Requests for reporting issues with product or the service that might not be a bug. \n\n  5. **Requests** : General requests from users to enable a feature or get some service. \n\nEach request may have multiple AI fields, meaning it could be tagged with more\nthan one category based on the issue discussion.\n\n##\n\nFilter by Auto-Categories\n\nYou can view and filter support requests based on the AI fields assigned by\nClearFeed directly from the ClearFeed dashboard.

Hover over the categories to read the context behind the categorization\n\n##\n\nUnderstanding Auto-Categories\n\nClearFeed's AI algorithm continuously monitors incoming requests and updates\ncategories based on the following criteria:\n\n  * **Public Comments** : Whenever a public comment is added to a ticket, ClearFeed automatically re-analyzes the conversation and updates the AI fields as needed. This ensures that the most recent context is captured and reflected in the category tags.\n\n  * **Ticket Resolution** : When a ticket is solved, ClearFeed performs another analysis to update the fields, ensuring that any additional information provided during the resolution process is captured.\n\n[PreviousWelcome Messages](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/welcome-\nmessages)[NextDigests](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-\nhelpdesk/notifications)\n\nLast updated 1 month ago\n\n"

On the ClearFeed web application, open the Collection where you want to enable Ticketing\n\n  2. Click on `Settings` tab, and expand the `Ticketing Settings` section.\n\n  3. Enable the toggle, and choose the `Zendesk` as the `Ticketing Integration`.\n\n  4. Choose the Trigger Mode: **Emoji**(Manual) or **Automatic**\n\n     * **Emoji:** Create tickets when the configured emoji is used on a message. \n\n     * **Automatic:** Create tickets for all new messages on a channel.\n\n  5. **Ask for Requestor Email:** Enable this checkbox to associate a separate requestor email for tickets initiated by responders.\n\n**Note:** This feature is helpful for agents filing tickets on behalf of\nrequestors (customers or internal users). It allows them to associate the\nticket with the requestor's email address instead of their own.\n\n  1. Click on `Save` to save the integration successfully\n\nClearFeed can give you the ability to push private comments from the triage\nchannel as **Internal Comments** on Zendesk. Learn how to enable the same\n[here](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels#push-private-\nmessages-to-tickets).\n\n##\n\nCreate Tickets\n\n###\n\nCreate Tickets Manually (using Emoji)\n\nHow to use emoji reaction to manually create a Zendesk ticket?\n\n  1. A conversation is initiated on the request channel.\n\n  2. React to the first message on the thread using the \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f emoji.\n\n  3. A Zendesk ticket is created for the thread. All messages in the thread (along with the attachments) are synced to the ticket.\n\n###\n\nCreate Tickets Automatically\n\nHow to automatically convert threads into Zendesk tickets?\n\n  1. Every new conversation (Slack thread) that is initiated on the request channel gets converted into a Zendesk ticket automatically.\n\n  2. As soon as the ticket conversation occurs, ClearFeed posts a message on the Slack thread sharing the Zendesk ticket details.\n\n###\n\nCreate from Triage Channel\n\nHow to file Zendesk tickets from the Triage channel?\n\nRequests in the Triage channel can be easily converted to Zendesk tickets\nusing the `More Actions` button. Follow the below steps to do so:\n\n  1. For any request on the Triage channel, click on the `More Actions` button.\n\n  2. This will open a modal. Here, select the `File a Zendesk Ticket` option and proceed.\n\n  3. This successfully converts the request into a Zendesk ticket.\n\nThe corresponding request channel thread on Slack now displays the `title`,\n`ID`, and `Status` of the Zendesk ticket.\n\n##\n\nFunctionalities\n\nOnce you create a Zendesk ticket from Slack, ClearFeed enables the following:\n\n  1. Replies on the Slack thread and the Zendesk ticket are synced bidirectionally.\n\n  2. The corresponding request channel thread on Slack now displays the `Title`, `ID`, `URL`, and `Status` of the Zendesk Ticket. \n\n  3. Status changes from Zendesk are reflected on Slack\n\n     * We also support showing Zendesk _Custom Statuses_ on Slack. \n\n  4. ClearFeed adds the following labels to the Zendesk ticket: slack-channel-name, clearfeed, name of the form used to create the ticket. \n\n  5. Public comments from the triage channel are also synced back to the Zendesk ticket.\n\n  6. Internal Comments from the Triage channel are synced back to the Zendesk ticket as Internal Notes. \n\n  7. Status change updates are posted on the thread when the Zendesk ticket is moved to `Solved` status. \n\n##\n\nSync Settings\n\nSync settings allow you to choose whether messages are synced bidirectionally\nor in a single direction. Additionally, you can decide if updates to the\nlinked ticket's status are shared in the Slack thread.\n\n###\n\nFor all Tickets\n\nTo configure common sync settings for all new tickets - follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n  1. Access Sync Settings by navigating to [**Objects**](https://web.clearfeed.app/objects/zendesk)\n\n  2. Choose your [**Message Sync Mode**](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/zendesk#message-sync-mode)\n\n  3. Select whether status updates are shared in the [**Status Sync Mode**](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/zendesk#status-sync-mode) setting\n\n###\n\nFor Individual Tickets\n\nYou can also configure different sync settings for individual tickets. Once a\nticket is created from Slack, access the three-dot menu (shown in the\nillustration below) and configure your settings.\n\nOnly [Responders](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/collections#responder-\nsettings) can configure Sync Settings for individual tickets from the request\nchannel in Slack\n\n###\n\nMessage Sync Mode\n\nDetermines how messages are synced between Slack and Zendesk.\n\n  * **2-way sync between Zendesk and Slack thread:** Replies from Slack are posted on Zendesk and comments from Zendesk are synced to Slack. \n\n    * **Only forward sync from Slack thread to Zendesk:** Replies from Slack are posted on Zendesk but comments from Zendesk are not posted back on Slack. \n\n  * **Only backward sync from Zendesk to Slack thread:** Only Zendesk comments are posted on Slack and replies from Slack do not go to Zendesk. \n\n  * **No sync between Zendesk and Slack thread:** No comments are synced from Slack or Zendesk. \n\n###\n\nStatus Sync Mode\n\nDetermine whether status updates are shared on the request channel thread on\nSlack or not.\n\nUpdates are only delivered when the status is changed to \"Solved\" or moved to\n\"Open\" from \"Solved\"\n\n  * **Sync key status changes from Zendesk to Slack thread:** Whenever the ticket is \"Solved\" or moved to \"Open\" from \"Solved - the updates are shared on Slack. \n\n  * **No sync of status changes from Zendesk to the Slack thread:** No status updates are synced to Slack. \n\n###\n\nDisconnect Tickets from Zendesk\n\nAfter the Support team resolves the issue and the ticket is transferred to\nanother team or the conversation shifts to a different topic, it may be\nnecessary to unlink the Zendesk ticket from the Slack thread. You can do this\ndirectly from Zendesk:\n\n  1. Open the Zendesk ticket that you want to stop syncing with Slack\n\n  2. Go to the `Tags` section \n\n  3. Add the following tag -> **cf-disabled**\n\nThis ticket will now stop syncing comments and status updates between Zendesk\nand Slack.\n\n##\n\nZendesk Forms\n\nClearFeed currently supports only specific Zendesk field types: text, Multi-\nline, Drop-down, Multi-select, Checkbox, Number, and Date. Additional field\ntypes will soon be supported.\n\nVisit the Forms section to learn how to set up forms and utilize them for\nticket creation.\n\n###\n\nCreating Tickets with Forms\n\n  * Once the forms are set up, users will see a **File Ticket** button. Clicking this button will prompt users to complete ticket creation. \n\n  * If multiple forms are set up, a drop-down will appear asking the user to choose which form to fill for the particular ticket. \n\n##\n\nSolving Tickets\n\nYou can solve Zendesk tickets from the request channel by clicking on the\n`Mark As Solved` button on the ticket details message.\n\nThis button can be configured to be accessed by _everyone_ or _only\nresponders_. If you want to configure the accessibility and visibility of this\naction, read about [Screen Configuration for Zendesk](/clearfeed-help-\ncenter/clearfeed-helpdesk/objects-fields-and-forms/for-zendesk-\nticketing/screens-for-zendesk-tickets) to understand the detailed steps.\n\n###\n\nMandatory fields\n\nOn Zendesk, you can configure the custom fields as **Required to solve a\nticket**. This ensures certain fields are always updated before tickets are\nresolved (read more [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-\nus/articles/4408846008218-Making-conditional-ticket-fields-required-)).\n\nIf you have configured fields on Zendesk that are required before solving a\nticket - ClearFeed will display these fields in a _**Solve ticket**_ dialog\nbox when you try to solve a ticket in which such mandatory fields are\nassociated.\n\n**Note:** This dialog box will only show the ClearFeed-supported Zendesk field\ntypes _(Text, Multi-line, Drop-down, Multi-select, Checkbox, Number, and\nDate)_.\n\nIf any other field types are required to solve the ticket - we will show an\nerror message stating the field names. These fields can be updated from\nZendesk to solve the ticket.\n\n##\n\nEdit Tickets from Slack\n\nYou can manage Zendesk tickets filed using ClearFeed directly from a Triage\nchannel. This allows agents to view and edit the ticket's details, and\ndirectly solve them, all from a Triage.\n\nLearn more about this [here](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-\nchannels/for-integrations).\n\n##\n\nReverse Zendesk Flow\n\nWork on Zendesk Tickets created from other channels (eg. email, help centre,\nchat) from Slack using ClearFeed's Reverse Zendesk flow.\n\n###\n\nSupported Workflow\n\n  * Zendesk tickets that are started outside of Slack (via email or help centre) can be brought to Slack\n\n  * ClearFeed would enable bi-directional sync of comments and status ensuring that the support team can remain on Slack first\n\n  * Agents can respond to these tickets from Slack. They can also edit the ticket properties from the triage channel\n\n  * If a Form has been used in Zendesk while creating the ticket - you can also choose to import that form in ClearFeed to display its values in Slack\n\n###\n\nSetup\n\n  1. Create a dedicated Slack channel (or reuse where the Zendesk ticket notifications would arrive. Also, monitor this channel using ClearFeed (learn [how to monitor a channel](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/manage-request-channels#adding-slack-channels))\n\n  2. Create a new **Slack Webhook Workflow**\n\n    1. Go to Slack Workflow Builder\n\n    2. Create a workflow and start the workflow from a webhook\n\n    3. Configure the variables **ticket_id** and **ticket_url**\n\n    4. As a next step, select Send Messages to a channel\n\n    5. Select the channel that we configured in Step 1. \n\n    6. Add the message exactly as follows: **Ticket #ticket_id needs attention**\n\n    7. Finish and publish the workflow\n\n  1. **Copy the Web Request URL** from the webhook workflow step once published. \n\n  1. Now go to Zendesk Admin Center \u2192 Webhooks and **Create a New Zendesk Webhook** as shown below\n\n     * The endpoint URL should be the same as the Web request URL copied from Slack in the previous step\n\n  1. **Create a new Zendesk Trigger:** Go to Zendesk Admin Center \u2192 Business Rules \u2192 Triggers and Create a new Zendesk trigger with the following conditions:\n\n  1. In the **Actions** section, choose **Notify by > Active webhook** and point to the Slack Webhook Web Request URL. \n\n     * The request body can be customized based on the variables set up in the Slack Webhook Workflow\n\n  1. **Whitelist the Slack Webhook Workflow Bot:** Go to the following page \u2192 <https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/users> and under **Whitelist Bot** , select and add the bot with the same name as the webhook workflow created previously.\n\n###\n\nTesting Workflow\n\n  1. Start a ticket directly from Zendesk or via email (to the Zendesk support group)\n\n  2. Notice how the ticket comes as a notification into Slack in the monitored channel\n\n  3. ClearFeed replies to the notification with ticket sync details\n\n  4. Reply to the Slack thread and observe how the comments get synced back to Zendesk and vice-versa. \n\n##\n\nFAQs\n\n  1. **What happens if a requestor tries to change the sync settings from the request channel?**\n\n**Ans:** If a requestor tries to modify any of the sync settings from Slack,\nthey see an error that points out that this setting is only accessible by\nresponders.\n\n"

We keep adding integrations and have an active product\nroadmap on this. If your integration is not listed here, please reach out to\nus via support@clearfeed.ai.\n\n  1. **What type of billing plans does ClearFeed support?**\n\nWe support both monthly billing plans as well as annual billing for upfront\npurchases at a discount (15%). The pricing for the starter and professional\nplans are shared on the [pricing\npage](https://clearfeed.ai/pricing#Integrations). For the enterprise package,\nyou should write to sales@clearfeed.ai or set up a demo on the website\n[here](https://clearfeed.ai/booking-page).\n\n  1. **My pricing structure is different from the pricing shared on the website. Are there any exceptions to this?**\n\nYes, you may have custom pricing shared with you by the sales team for the\nEnterprise Package. You can write to us if you need to clarify your pricing at\n[sales@clearfeed.ai](mailto:sales@clearfeed.ai).\n\n  1. **How do you calculate the number of tickets in a given month?**\n\nThis is calculated based on the number of new tickets that you create via\nClearFeed from Slack to the tools that you plan to integrate with ClearFeed.\nClearFeed Integrations subscription includes access to integrations across all\ntools mentioned in FAQ-1. The usage of ClearFeed integrations is determined by\nthe total number of tickets created on the integrated tools at the end of the\nbilling month.\n\n  1. **How does ClearFeed do annual billing?**\n\nTo avail of the annual discount (e.g., 15%), you must pay for the upfront\npurchase of ClearFeed Ticket Packages at the beginning of the contract period.\nYou will be charged once for a contract duration of 1 year based on your\nselected plan.\n\n  1. **How are monthly overages calculated for the annual plan?**\n\nAny additional usage of tickets in a given month will be charged based on the\nactuals of additional usage. You will be charged the per unit fee in batches\nof 50 tickets with the per-ticket cost of your purchased annual plan. For\nexample, if you have purchased an annual professional plan of 500\ntickets/month @ 129$/month (Annual Plan at 15% discount). In a given month, if\nyou use 720 tickets, then we will apply additional pricing for 150 tickets\n(120 is rounded up to 150 - 3 batches of 50) at unit pricing of 129$/500 =\n0.258$ / Ticket. This would work out to be 38.7$ (150X0.258$).\n\n  1. **How does ClearFeed do billing for monthly subscriptions?**\n\nWith ClearFeed monthly subscriptions, you need to pre-purchase the capacity to\nuse a certain number of tickets for a given month. As soon as you move out of\nthe free tier, you will need to sign up for the paid plan on your plan\n(Starter / Professional / Enterprise). For the first month, we will bill you\nfor minimum usage (50 tickets) and that will mark the start of the contract.\nAt the end of the month, overages are charged based on actual usage. For every\nsubsequent month, you will be charged assuming that you will use the same\nnumber of tickets as the previous month. There will be overages/adjustments\ndone every month based on actual usage.\n\n  1. **What is the minimum monthly billing for the monthly subscription?**\n\nThere would be a minimum monthly billing for 50 tickets.\n\n  1. **How do you determine which usage bundle am I a part of based on the usage?**\n\nUsage bundles are designed to offer quantity discounts for you. As the number\nof tickets increases, the per-unit pricing for tickets goes down with the\nusage bundles.\n\nBased on your ticket volume, the most appropriate usage bundle will be\nautomatically detected and applied, such that your pricing is the lowest for a\ngiven ticket volume.\n\nFor example, if your usage is 4000 tickets in the professional tier:\n\n  * We apply the pricing for the usage bundle of 2500 tickets - 289$\n\n  * For an additional 1500 tickets - we apply the same unit price - 173.4$\n\n  * The total pricing works out to be 462.4$\n\nIf your usage, on the other hand, is 4500 tickets in the professional tier\n\n  * We will make you eligible for a 5000 tickets user bundle at 489$\n\n  1. **How can I see the number of tickets created by my organization?**\n\nYou can keep track of the number of tickets created for your ClearFeed account\nthrough our reporting. Jump to the following page -\n<https://web.clearfeed.app/reports> and apply the filters as shown below:\n\n  * Metric = Number of Requests\n\n  * Date Range = This Month\n\n  * Toggle \"Requests with Tickets\" to ON. \n\n  1. **How do you adjust the billing for monthly subscriptions at the end of each month?**\n\nLet\u2019s take an example. If we bill you an amount 129$ at the start of the month\nconsidering usage last month was for 500 tickets.\n\n  * At the end of the month, if the actual usage is 250 tickets (priced at 89$), we will provide you a rebate of 40$ (129$-89$). \n\n  * At the end of the month, if the actual usage is 1000 tickets (pried at 189$), we will charge you an overage of 60$ (189$-129$).\n\n  1. **What if I want to cancel the plan in the middle of a billing cycle?**\n\nThis is only possible to do for the monthly subscription plan. If you\nunsubscribe in the middle of the month, we will adjust your billing at the end\nof the monthly calendar cycle for that month and make the adjustment based on\nthe actual usage of that month. If there are any applicable rebates, we will\nreimburse them to your credit card.\n\n[PreviousInternal Helpdesk](/clearfeed-help-center/pricing-and-\nbilling/billing/internal-helpdesk)[NextClearFeed Release\nChangelog](/clearfeed-help-center/changelog/clearfeed-release-changelog)\n\nLast updated 7 months ago\n\n"

This will log out all users who did not log in via the selected authentication method.\n\n  4.

If you'd\nlike to enable SAML authentication, please reach out to us at\nsupport@clearfeed.ai or via Slack.\n\n##\n\nSAML SSO\n\n###\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore configuring SAML SSO in ClearFeed, ensure the following:\n\n  * Login and create an account in ClearFeed using any of the existing Authentication Methods (Google/Microsoft/Magic Link)\n\n  * Contact ClearFeed support via Slack or email at support@clearfeed.ai to enable the SAML SSO feature for your ClearFeed account. This feature is not automatically available and requires activation by the support team.\n\n  * Ensure you have administrative access to both ClearFeed and your identity provider.\n\n  * If you are using [multiple accounts](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/multiple-clearfeed-accounts) in ClearFeed, ensure you are logged in to the Parent Account.\n\n  * You have the SAML identity provider setup screen and documentation open.\n\nSAML can be configured by visiting this\n[**link**](https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/security) and clicking on the\nconfigure button.\n\n###\n\nCreate SAML Configuration\n\n####\n\nIdentity Provider Entity ID\n\nObtain the Entity ID from your identity provider.\n\n  * This is a unique identifier that the SAML protocol uses to exchange data between the identity provider and ClearFeed.\n\n####\n\nSSO URL\n\nProvide the SAML SSO URL from your identity provider.\n\n  * This URL is where SAML authentication requests are sent and must be a valid URL.\n\n####\n\nX.509 Certificates\n\nSupply one or more X.509 certificates provided by your identity provider.\n\n  * These certificates must include the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` markers and are used for validating SAML responses.\n\n####\n\nCompany ID\n\nUnique identifier for your company within ClearFeed.\n\n  * It is necessary for users to log in via SAML SSO.\n\n  * **Note:** This ID cannot be changed from the app once set up. Please contact ClearFeed support for help in getting it changed.\n\n####\n\nAdditional Information Required by your IdP\n\n  * **Audience/Service Provider Entity ID** : This is a predefined value shown on the screen, which must be entered on your identity provider's configuration page.\n\n  * **Callback URL** : The Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL is also predefined, and provided in the SAML configuration modal. This URL is where the SAML response is sent after authentication. You'll need to register this URL with the SAML identity provider.\n\n###\n\nSAML Assertion\n\nThe SAML Assertion from your identity provider must include the following for\nsuccessful authentication:\n\n`<saml:Subject>` and `<saml:NameID>` elements must be present, and\nthe`<NameID>` element must contain the user's email in the following format:\n\nCopy\n\n    \n    \n    <Subject>\n      <NameID Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress\">\n      john@clearfeed.ai\n      </NameID>\n    </Subject>\n\nSAML authentication will not function without the presence of the above\nelements in the SAML Assertion.\n\n###\n\nUser Attributes\n\nClearFeed also searches for the following attributes in the SAML assertion\npayload to enhance the user experience within the ClearFeed Web App. While\nthese attributes are not mandatory for authentication, having them present can\nimprove usability:\n\n  * `fullName`, `name`, `displayName` for the user's name.\n\n  * `photoURL`, `avatar`, `picture` for the user's avatar.\n\n###\n\nUser Login Flow\n\nCurrently, we don't support the Identity Provider initiated flow, which means\nthat every time the user wants to log in to ClearFeed via SAML SSO, the user\nwill have to first navigate to <https://web.clearfeed.app/login> and click on\n`Continue with SAML SSO`\n\nOnce SAML SSO is enforced, alternative authentication methods (such as Google,\nMicrosoft, or Magic Link) cannot be used to log in to ClearFeed.\nAdministrators of the parent account can still log in using the alternative\nauthentication methods. This ensures they do not get locked out in the event\nof any issues with the SAML configuration.\n\n* * *\n\nNote: It is essential to consult your identity provider's documentation to\nobtain the correct values for the entity ID, SSO URL, and X.509 certificates.\nAdditionally, regularly check for any updates or rotation of certificates to\nmaintain SAML SSO functionality.\n\n##\n\nWalkthrough: Setup SSO with Okta\n\nWatch this short video to understand how to setup SSO with Okta.\n\nIf you cannot open the video below, access it\n[here](https://www.veed.io/view/4fd72797-d7cb-4508-a6ee-\ned76fc21eea1?panel=share).\n\n##\n\nFAQs\n\n####\n\n1\\. If I have multiple ClearFeed accounts, does enforcing sign-in work for all\naccounts?\n\nAns: No, enforcing sign-in is an individual account-level setting. If you have\nmultiple accounts, users can still log in to other accounts using any of the\nlogin methods.\n\n####\n\n2\\. What happens if a user tries to log in via a method other than the\nenforced one?\n\nAns: Users are shown an error message if they try to log in via another\nmethod. E.g. If an account has Google Sign-in enforced - and if a user tries\nto log in via the magic link. Upon clicking on the generated sign-in link in\ntheir email - they would see an error as shown below:\n\n"

Choose support team members as **Responders**\n\n     * By default, all users that are agents will be considered as Responders\n\n     * Go to the [Users](https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/users) section to add your support team members as users and make them **Agents**\n\n       * Only Agents can reply to the tickets from the triage channel and Clearfeed web application and can be assigned tickets\n\n       * Non-Agents can still view tickets and make private comments on tickets\n\n  4. Add **Request channels** on which you plan to provide support to your users\n\n     * All public Slack channels can be added from the web app\n\n     * Private Slack channels can be added by typing `/invite @Clearfeed` on the Slack channels. They can only be added after a Collection is created\n\n  5. Add a [**Triage channel** ](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels)for the support team to work from on Slack\n\n     * You can select `Create new channel` or `Select existing` option\n\n     * Your support team can also work directly from Request channels, in which case you can opt in `Proceed without triage`\n\n  6. Under **Ticketing** , ClearFeed will be selected as ticketing integration Choose the trigger mode for ticket creation.\n\n     * Trigger mode for the ticket can be an emoji (eg. \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f) applied to the thread or tickets can be auto-created on every new message on the request channel\n\n  7.

        "title": "Forms",
        "text": "ClearFeed improves ticket management with Forms that simplify creating and\nediting tickets directly from your request and triage channels.\n\nBy default, ClearFeed Ticket Forms include Title, Priority, and Assignee\nfields. To add custom fields, you need to first create them. Learn how to do\nthat [here](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/custom-fields#how-do-i-\ncreate-a-new-custom-field).\n\n##\n\nConfiguring Forms\n\nEach ClearFeed Form has two parts - _**When creating a ticket**_ __ and\n_**When editing a ticket**_ _._\n\n  * Navigate to [**Objects**](https://web.clearfeed.app/objects/clearfeed)**** on the ClearFeed web console and click on `Add Form`\n\n  * Provide a suitable name for the form (note: Form name will be visible to the requestors when creating the ticket).\n\n###\n\n_Create_ Form\n\n  1.  _Title_ and _Priority_ fields are added to the Form by default. \n\n     * These properties are _Pre-filled_ by ClearFeed (that means, a value is assigned to these fields when a ticket is created - but you can still modify their values). \n\n  2. From the ClearFeed Fields table - add the fields you want to be a part of the form. \n\n  3. Configure properties such as setting up a field alias, adding placeholder text and hint, making fields optional, setting a default value, or hiding a field.\n\n     * Learn more about field properties [**here**](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/forms#field-properties). \n\n  4. Save your configuration and move on to [configure the Edit Action form](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/forms#configure-the-edit-action-form) (optional). \n\nFields added in the _Create_ form will be visible to responders on the triage\nchannel and web dashboard when working on tickets.\n\n###\n\n_Edit_ Form\n\nIf the Edit Form is enabled - users will see an Edit Ticket button when they\ncreate a ticket. You can provide requestors and responders the exclusive\nability to modify fields after ticket creation.\n\nOnly the fields that are a part of the _Edit form_ can be modified from the\ntriage channel after a ticket is created.\n\n  1. Add fields from the `ClearFeed Fields` table available on the right-hand side. \n\n  2. Configure properties such as making fields optional, setting a default value, or hiding a field.\n\n     * Learn more about field properties [**here**](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/forms#field-properties). \n\n**Pro tip:** Use the **Add all Create Form fields** button to quickly add\nfields that are a part of the _Create_ form to the _Edit_ form.\n\n###\n\n**Ticket Creation Without a Form**\n\n  * If all fields in a form are hidden, both responders and requesters will be able to create a ticket without filling out a form.\n\n  * If all fields in a Form are set to be editable by _only responders_ , requesters will be able to create a ticket without filling out a form.\n\n    * **Note** : In both cases, the pre-filled or default value of fields will be populated.\n\n##\n\nField Properties\n\n  * **Removing Fields:** Remove fields from a Form using the Delete icon.\n\n    * **Note:**_Title_ and _Priority_ are non-removable in the _Create Action_ form. However, they can be hidden to prevent modification.\n\n  * **Reordering Fields:** To customize the order of the fields, click and hold a field in the left column, then drag and drop it to your desired position in the sequence.\n\n    * **Note:** Non-removable fields will always be on top, while hidden fields will automatically move to the bottom once the changes are saved.\n\n  * **Non-responder Field Label:** This determines the field name that would be displayed to the requestors when they use the form. \n\n  * **Placeholder Text:** The text that is shown inside the field before users enter their information.\n\n  * **Hint Text:** The hint text that is shown below the field to guide users on what to enter. Think of this as the field description.\n\n  * **Default Values:** You can add default values to the fields. Default values automatically populate the corresponding customer fields when a ticket is created.\n\n    * **Note** : Default values cannot be entered for non-removable fields.\n\n  * **Hidden Fields:** To ensure specific fields are not modified during ticket creation, you can hide them from the Create Action Form.\n\n    * **Note** : When hiding a field, it is mandatory to assign a default value to it.\n\n  * **Permissions:** Specify who is required to fill a given field when creating or editing a ticket using the `Editable by` column. Choose between _All users_ or _Only responders_.\n\n    * **Note** : Only users with the specified permission for a field will see it in the form when creating a ticket on Slack. However, they must mandatorily fill it to proceed.\n\n  * **Required Field** : Specify if the field is optional or mandatory when creating or editing a ticket in the **Required** **field** column.\n\n    * **Note:** By default, the Required field value is set to 'Required' whenever a new field is created.\n\n##\n\nMapping ClearFeed Forms to Collection\n\nBy default, all active ClearFeed Forms are available for ticket creation in\nCollections with ClearFeed ticketing enabled. However, you can map specific\nForms to a Collection to restrict the available Forms for ticket creation.\n\nClearFeed Ticketing needs to be enabled for a Collection.\n\n  * Only Forms with an active [_Create Action_](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/product-features/objects-fields-and-forms/for-clearfeed-ticketing/ticketing-forms-for-clearfeed/configuring-clearfeed-forms/when-creating-a-ticket) Form will be available for mapping.\n\n  * Any Form can be mapped to multiple collections.\n\n####\n\nHow to map Forms to a Collection?\n\n  1. Navigate to `Collections -> Settings`.\n\n  2. Go to `Ticketing Settings`.\n\n  3. In the Forms Availability section, select the `Specific Forms` option.\n\n  4. From the available Forms, select the ones you'd like to associate with this Collection.\n\nIf a mapped Form (or its _Create Action_ form) is **disabled** , it will break\nthe Form's existing mapping with any Collection, and prevent it from being\nused to create tickets on Slack.\n\n##\n\nScreens\n\nWhen requests are turned into ClearFeed tickets, details are sent back to the\nrequester in a designated ticket message block on the request channel.\n\n  * The screens section lets you customize the ticket message shown to the requester. You can show or hide ticket fields and manage the ticket resolution button.\n\nEnabling ClearFeed Ticketing is mandatory to share the ticket details with the\nrequester. Learn more on how to enable ticketing\n[here](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/product-\nfeatures/clearfeed-ticketing).\n\nTo configure the ticket message for ClearFeed ticketing, follow the steps\ngiven below:\n\n  1. Head over to the `Objects` section on the ClearFeed web application -> <https://web.clearfeed.app/objects>\n\n  2. Under the ticketing drop-down, select `ClearFeed Ticketing`.\n\n  3. Select `Screens` from the tabs mentioned under ClearFeed Ticketing.\n\n###\n\nFields\n\n  * **Assignee** \\- You can choose to show the name of the Assignee of the ClearFeed ticket on the request channel.\n\n  * **Priority** \\- The priority of the ticket can be shown to the requester using this field. The priority of the ticket can be as follows: `Urgent`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`.\n\n  * **Status** \\- By default, the Status of the ticket is always shown to the requester. This cannot be configured to be hidden. The following statuses are shown to the requester: `Open`, `In Progress`, `On Hold`, `Pending`, `Solved`, `Closed`.\n\n  * **Form Name -** Name of the Form used to create the ticket.\n\n    * Note: Form name appears only if there is more than one form in the account.\n\n  * **Fields populated by Create Form -** Only non-empty, non-hidden fields, marked as editable by 'All' in the 'Create Form', will be displayed in the message.\n\n  * **Fields populated by Edit Form -** Only non-empty, non-hidden fields, marked as editable by 'All' in the 'Edit Form', will be displayed in the message.\n\n###\n\nActions\n\n  1.  _**Mark As Solved**_ button: You can choose to expose the `Mark as Solved` button which allows responders/requesters to solve a ticket right from the request channel.\n\n     * Check the option to display the `Mark as Solved` button on the ticket message block.\n\n       * **Permissions:** `All` or `Responder`.\n\n         * `All` \\- Allows access to the `Mark as Solved` button to both the requester and responder\n\n         * `Responder` \\- Only agents/responders will be able to use the `Mark as Solved` action to resolve tickets.\n\n  2. _**Edit Ticket**_ __ button: The Edit ticket button will be present on the ticket message by default whenever the Edit action Form is enabled.\n\n     * Disabling a Parent Form (or its underlying _Edit_ action form) will disable the editing feature for existing tickets created using it and the `Edit Ticket` button will be hidden from all new tickets created using the Form.\n\n##\n\nFAQs\n\n  1. **What is the Default ClearFeed Ticket Form and can I modify it?**\n\n**Answer:** The Default ClearFeed Ticket Form is a pre-built form that comes\nwith your ClearFeed account. It's designed to be a foundation for managing\ntickets within the system. By default, it doesn't show any fields when\ncreating a ticket. However, you have the freedom to customize this form and\nadd the specific fields you need to fit your purposes.\n\n  1. **What happens if all fields in a form are hidden?**\n\n**Answer:** If all fields in a form are hidden, both responders and requesters\ncan create a ticket without filling out a form. The pre-filled or default\nvalues of the fields will automatically be populated in the ClearFeed ticket.\n\n  1. **Can requesters create a ticket without filling out a form if all fields are editable only by responders?**\n\n**Answer:** Yes, if all fields in a form are set to be editable by only\nresponders, requesters can still create a ticket without filling out a form.\nThe pre-filled or default values of the fields will be populated in the\nClearFeed ticket.\n\n  1. **Will the pre-filled or default values be used if the form fields are hidden or set to be editable only by responders?**\n\n**Answer:** Yes, in both cases\u2014whether the form fields are hidden or set to be\neditable only by responders\u2014the pre-filled or default values of the fields\nwill be used in the ClearFeed ticket.\n\n  1. **Is it necessary for responders to fill out the form if the fields are hidden or set to be editable only by them?**\n\n**Answer:** No, responders don't need to fill out the form in these scenarios.\nThe ticket creation process will rely on the pre-filled or default values of\nthe fields.\n\n  1. **What happens if the Parent Form or its Edit action is inactive?**\n\n**Answer:** If the Parent Form used for creating a ticket, or its underlying\nEdit action, is inactive, you will be unable to edit existing tickets that\nwere filed through that Form.\n\n  1. **What happens if all fields in an Edit Form are hidden when responders and requesters click the Edit ticket button?**\n\n**Answer:** If all fields in an Edit Form are hidden, clicking the Edit ticket\nbutton will update the respective default values of the ClearFeed ticket\nfields without showing any form on Slack.\n\n  1. **Does ClearFeed automatically capture the placeholder text, hint text, and field alias for fields that are a part of the Create action form to the Edit form?**\n\n**Answer:** Yes - once you set up your Create action form - move to the Edit\nform and click on the button that says `+ Add all Create form fields`. That\nshould copy all fields and the relevant properties.\n\nIf you have existing fields set up in the Edit form - removing them and re-\nadding would also copy all properties from the Create form.\n\n  1. **How can I view and edit fields that are part of the Create form?**\n\n**Answer:** You can do that from the following places:\n\n  * Triage Channel: The triage channel view of the ticket displays all fields that are part of the Create form. \n\n  * Web Console: You can view and edit all fields belonging to the Create form from the web dashboard view of the ticket.\n\n  1. **How can I view and edit fields that are part of the Edit form?**\n\n**Answer:** You can do that from the following places:\n\n  * Triage Channel: The triage channel view of the ticket displays an \"Edit Ticket\" button when the Edit form is enabled. After clicking the \"Edit Ticket\" button, you can edit all the fields that belong to the Edit form. \n\n  * Web Console: You can view and edit all fields belonging to the Edit form from the web dashboard view of the ticket.\n\n"

Navigate to the integrations page on the ClearFeed web app (<https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/integrations>)\n\n  2. Under the list of integrations, you'll find Intercom as shown below.\n\n  3. Click on `Connect` button.\n\n  4. You will be redirected to Intercom login. Sign in using the account you want to integrate with ClearFeed.\n\n  5. Once you sign in, you will need to authorize ClearFeed to integrate with Intercom by clicking on `Authorize Access`\n\n  6. You will then be redirected to the ClearFeed web app where you will get a success message.\n\n##\n\nEnable Ticketing\n\n  1. On the ClearFeed web application, open the Collection where you want to enable Ticketing\n\n  2. Click on the `Settings` tab, and expand the `Ticketing` section.\n\n  3. Enable the toggle, and choose `Intercom` as the `Ticketing platform`.\n\n  4. Choose the Trigger Mode: **Emoji** (Manual) or **Automatic**\n\n     * **Emoji:** Create tickets when the configured emoji is used on a message.\n\n     * **Automatic:** Create tickets for all new messages on a channel.\n\n  5. **Ask for Requestor Email:** Enable this checkbox to associate a separate requestor email for tickets initiated by responders.\n\n**Note:** This feature is helpful for agents filing tickets on behalf of\nrequestors (customers or internal users). It allows them to associate the\nticket with the requestor's email address instead of their own.\n\n  1. Click on `Save` to save the integration successfully\n\n##\n\nCreate Tickets\n\n###\n\nCreate Tickets Manually (using Emoji)\n\nHow to use emoji reaction to manually create an Intercom ticket?\n\n  1. A conversation is initiated on the request channel.\n\n  2. React to the first message on the thread using the \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f emoji.\n\n  3. An Intercom ticket is created for the thread. All messages in the thread (along with the attachments) are synced to the ticket.\n\n###\n\nCreate Tickets Automatically\n\nAutomatically convert threads to Intercom Tickets\n\n  1. Every new conversation (Slack thread) that is initiated on the request channel gets converted into an Intercom ticket automatically.\n\n  2. As soon as the ticket conversation occurs, ClearFeed posts a message on the Slack thread sharing the Intercom ticket details.\n\n###\n\nCreate Tickets from Triage\n\nHow to file Intercom tickets from triage channel?\n\nRequests in the Triage channel can be easily converted to Intercom tickets\nusing the `More Actions` button. Follow the steps below to do so:\n\n  1. For any request on the Triage channel, click on the `More Actions` button.\n\n  2. This will open a modal. Here, select the `File an Intercom Ticket` option and proceed.\n\n  3. This successfully converts the request into an Intercom ticket.\n\nThe corresponding request channel thread on Slack now displays the `title`,\n`ID`, and `Status` of the Intercom ticket.\n\n##\n\nFunctionalities\n\n  * Replies on the Slack thread and the Intercom ticket are synced bidirectionally.\n\n  * The corresponding request channel thread on Slack now displays the Title, ID, URL, and Status of the Intercom ticket.\n\n  * Status changes from Intercom are reflected on Slack.\n\n  * ClearFeed adds the following labels to the Intercom ticket: slack-channel-name, clearfeed, name of the form used to create the ticket.\n\n  * Public comments from the triage channel are also synced back to the Intercom ticket.\n\n  * Status change updates are posted on the thread when the Intercom ticket is moved to Solved status.\n\n##\n\nSync Settings\n\nSync settings allow you to choose whether messages are synced bidirectionally\nor in a single direction. Additionally, you can decide if updates to the\nlinked ticket's status are shared in the Slack thread.\n\n###\n\nFor all Tickets\n\nTo configure common sync settings for all new tickets - follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n  1. Access Sync Settings by navigating to [**Objects**](https://web.clearfeed.app/objects/intercom)\n\n  2. Choose your [**Message Sync Mode**](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/~/changes/VInJM1SaJBSwVFkK5V5m/clearfeed-helpdesk/objects-fields-and-forms/intercom/sync-settings#message-sync-mode)\n\n  3. Select whether status updates are shared in the [**Status Sync Mode**](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/~/changes/VInJM1SaJBSwVFkK5V5m/clearfeed-helpdesk/objects-fields-and-forms/intercom/sync-settings#status-sync-mode) setting\n\n###\n\nFor Individual Tickets\n\nYou can also configure different sync settings for individual tickets. Once a\nticket is created from Slack, access the three-dot menu (shown in the\nillustration below) and configure your settings.\n\nOnly [Responders](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/collections#responder-\nsettings) can configure Sync Settings for individual tickets from the request\nchannel in Slack\n\n###\n\nMessage Sync Mode\n\nDetermines how messages are synced between Slack and Intercom.\n\n  * **2-way sync between Intercom and Slack thread:** Replies from Slack are posted on Intercom, and comments from Intercom are synced to Slack.\n\n  * **Only forward sync from Slack thread to Intercom:** Replies from Slack are posted on Intercom, but comments from Intercom are not posted back on Slack.\n\n  * **Only backward sync from Intercom to Slack thread:** Only Intercom comments are posted on Slack, and replies from Slack do not go to Intercom.\n\n  * **No sync between Intercom and Slack thread:** No comments are synced from Slack or Intercom.\n\n###\n\nStatus Sync Mode\n\nDetermine whether status updates are shared on the request channel thread on\nSlack or not.\n\nUpdates are only delivered when the status is changed to \"Solved\" or moved to\n\"Open\" from \"Solved\"\n\n  * **Sync key status changes from Intercom to Slack thread:** Whenever the ticket is \"Solved\" or moved to \"Open\" from \"Solved\" - the updates are shared on Slack.\n\n  * **No sync of status changes from Intercom to the Slack thread:** No status updates are synced to Slack.\n\n##\n\nIntercom Forms\n\nClearFeed supports importing existing Intercom Ticket Types and configuring\nthem as Forms.\n\nVisit the Forms section to learn how to set up forms and utilize them for\nticket creation.\n\n###\n\nCreating Tickets with Forms\n\n  * Once the forms are set up, users will see a **File Ticket** button. Clicking this button will prompt users to complete ticket creation.\n\n  * If multiple forms are set up, a drop-down will appear asking the user to choose which form to fill for the particular ticket.\n\n##\n\nReverse Intercom Flow\n\n  * Intercom tickets started outside of Slack (via email or help centre) can be brought to Slack.\n\n  * ClearFeed would enable bi-directional sync of comments and status ensuring that the support team can remain on Slack first while details are captured in the Intercom ticket.\n\n###\n\nSetup\n\n  1. Create a dedicated Slack channel to receive the tickets and monitor the channel using ClearFeed ([learn how to monitor a channel](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/manage-request-channels)).\n\n     * Configure Intercom as the ticketing integration for the Collection to which the channel created above is added - [Setup Intercom ticketing for a Collection](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/intercom#enable-ticketing)\n\n  2. Install the **Intercom Slack app** on your Slack workspace.\n\n  3. **Create a new Intercom Workflow** : Follow the steps [**here**](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/6891484-slack-app#h_a5700e2cbe) to create a **Notify Slack channel workflow**.\n\nAdd the **Created via API is false** filter to exclude notifications for\nIntercom tickets created through ClearFeed from another Slack channel. This\nensures you only receive notifications for tickets directly submitted via\nIntercom.\n\n  1. **Whitelist the Intercom Slack Bot:** Go to the following page \u2192 <https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/users> and under **Whitelist Bot** , select the Intercom Slack app.\n\nHere's how the tickets from Intercom would look like coming into Slack:\n\nThe IDs in the intercom notification message and the message we send can be\ndifferent. This happens when the ticket ID and the conversation ID for the\nsame tickets are not the same. The ID shown on the message we send is the\nticket ID, visible to the requester. The ID shown on the intercom notification\nmessage is the Conversation ID.\n\n###\n\nCreating and working on Tickets using this approach\n\n  1. Start a ticket directly from Intercom or via email (to the Intercom support group)\n\n  2. Notice how the ticket comes as a notification into Slack in the monitored channel\n\n  3. ClearFeed replies to the notification with ticket sync details\n\n  4. Reply to the Slack thread and observe how the comments get synced back to Intercom and vice-versa.\n\n[PreviousForms](/clearfeed-help-\ncenter/integrations/freshdesk/forms)[NextForms](/clearfeed-help-\ncenter/integrations/intercom/forms)\n\nLast updated 17 days ago\n\n"

From the available Forms, select the ones you'd like to associate with this Collection.\n\n##\n\nFAQs\n\n  1. **What is the Default Freshdesk Ticket Form and can I modify it?**\n\nAnswer: The Default Freshdesk Ticket Form is pre-built with your Freshdesk\naccount. By default, it doesn't show any fields when creating a ticket.\nHowever, you can customize this form and add the specific fields you need to\nfit your purposes.\n\n  1. **Can all Create action forms in Freshdesk be disabled?**\n\nAnswer: The Create action form is enabled by default and cannot be disabled\nunless you create a new form with its Create action enabled. It is mandatory\nto have at least one form with an enabled Create action at all times to ensure\nseamless ticket creation.\n\n  1. **What happens if all fields in a form are hidden?**\n\nAnswer: If all fields in a form are hidden, both responders and requesters can\ncreate a ticket without filling out a form. The pre-filled or default values\nof the fields will automatically be populated in the Freshdesk ticket.\n\n  1. **Can requesters create a ticket without filling out a form if all fields are editable only by responders?**\n\nAnswer: Yes, if all fields in a form are set to be editable by only\nresponders, requesters can still create a ticket without filling out a form.\nThe pre-filled or default values of the fields will be populated in the\nFreshdesk ticket.\n\n  1. **Will the pre-filled or default values be used if the form fields are hidden or set to be editable only by responders?**\n\nAnswer: Yes, in both cases\u2014whether the form fields are hidden or set to be\neditable only by responders\u2014the pre-filled or default values of the fields\nwill be used in the Freshdesk ticket.\n\n  1. **Is it necessary for responders to fill out the form if the fields are hidden or set to be editable only by them?**\n\nAnswer: No, responders don't need to fill out the form in these scenarios. The\nticket creation process will rely on the pre-filled or default values of the\nfields.\n\n  1. **What happens if the Parent Form or its Edit action is inactive?**\n\nAnswer: If the Parent Form used for creating a ticket, or its underlying Edit\naction, is inactive, you will be unable to edit existing tickets that were\nfiled through that Form.\n\n  1. **What happens if all fields in an Edit Form are hidden when responders and requesters click the Edit ticket button?**\n\nAnswer: If all fields in an Edit Form are hidden, clicking the Edit ticket\nbutton will update the respective default values of the Freshdesk ticket\nfields without showing any form on Slack.\n\n  1. **What happens when fields are removed from the parent Freshdesk form?**\n\nAnswer: Removed fields are automatically deleted from both the Create and Edit\nforms in Freshdesk and are no longer selectable for future configurations.\nHowever, the original fields remain accessible when editing existing tickets.\n\n  1. **What occurs when fields are added to the parent Freshdesk form?**\n\nAnswer: Newly added fields become available for selection in the imported form\non Freshdesk, allowing you to include them as needed. Additions to the Edit\nform won't reflect on previously created tickets.\n\n  1. **Will newly added fields in the Freshdesk form be available for editing existing tickets?**\n\nAnswer: No, users will see only the original set of fields when editing\nexisting tickets.\n\n  1. **How does Freshdesk ensure synchronization with the parent Freshdesk form?**\n\nAnswer: Freshdesk automatically updates the imported forms to match changes in\nthe parent Freshdesk form, adding or removing fields as necessary to maintain\nsynchronization.\n\n  1. **What happens if a mapped Form (or its Create action form) is disabled?**\n\nAnswer: Disabling a mapped Form or its Create action form will break the\nForm's existing mapping with any Collection and prevent it from being used to\ncreate tickets on Slack.\n\n"

The payload includes the following fields:\n\n  1. `version`: The version of the payload format. Currently set to `'1.0'`.\n\n  2. `workflow_delay`: The delay, in minutes, before the workflow was triggered.\n\n  3. `workflow_name`: The name of the workflow that was triggered.\n\n  4. `workflow_message_ts`: The id of the message that triggered the workflow.\n\n  5. `workflow_message_text`: The text of the message that triggered the workflow.\n\n  6. `workflow_message_url`: The URL of the message that triggered the workflow.\n\n  7. `workflow_message_author_id`: The ID of the author of the message that triggered the workflow.\n\n  8. `workflow_message_author_name`: The name of the author of the message that triggered the workflow.\n\n  9. `request_id`: The ID of the request associated with the workflow.\n\n  10. `request_state`: The state of the request associated with the workflow.\n\n  11. `request_title`: The title of the request associated with the workflow.\n\n  12. `request_priority`: The priority of the request associated with the workflow.\n\n  13. `request_thread_ts`: The ID of the thread where the request message was sent.\n\n  14. `request_thread_url`: The URL of the thread where the request message was sent.\n\n  15. `request_channel_id`: The ID of the channel where the request was received.\n\n  16. `request_channel_name`: The name of the channel where the request was received.\n\n  17. `request_collection_id`: The ID of the collection that contains the channel where the request was received.\n\n  18. `request_collection_name`: The name of the collection that contains the channel where the request was received.\n\n**Example Payload:**\n\nCopy\n\n    \n    \n    {\n      \"version\": \"1.0\",\n      \"workflow_delay\": \"15\",\n      \"workflow_name\": \"Escalation Reminder\",\n      \"workflow_message_ts\": \"1669086095.123456\",\n      \"workflow_message_text\": \"This is the message that triggered the workflow.\",\n      \"workflow_message_url\": \"https://clearfeed.slack.com/archives/C0ABCD123/p1669086095123456\",\n      \"workflow_message_author_id\": \"U12345\",\n      \"workflow_message_author_name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"request_id\": 123,\n      \"request_state\": \"Open\",\n      \"request_title\": \"Need assistance with XYZ\",\n      \"request_priority\": \"high\",\n      \"request_thread_ts\": \"1669086095.987654\",\n      \"request_thread_url\": \"https://clearfeed.slack.com/archives/C0ABCD123/p1691040592308569?thread_ts=1669086095.987654\",\n      \"request_channel_id\": \"C0ABCD123\",\n      \"request_channel_name\": \"clearfeed_swiftcorp_solutions\",\n      \"request_collection_id\": 123,\n      \"request_collection_name\": \"Premium Customer Channels\"\n    }\n\n###\n\nWebhook Headers\n\nTo verify the authenticity of the request source, ClearFeed adds the following\nheaders to the HTTP POST request:\n\n  1. `X-Cf-Signature`: A signature generated using a secret key known only to ClearFeed and the receiving server. You can use this signature to verify that the request has not been tampered with and originated from ClearFeed.\n\n  2. `X-Cf-Timestamp`: The timestamp indicates the exact time the request was sent. You can use this timestamp along with the signature to validate the request's freshness and prevent replay attacks.\n\nTo validate that webhook requests you receive originated from ClearFeed, read\nmore details [here](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-\nhelpdesk/workflows#validating-requests).\n\n###\n\nTesting Webhook Payload\n\nIf you want to send a test payload, you can do this by executing a cURL\ncommand such as the one shown below:\\\n\nCopy\n\n    \n    \n    curl --location 'https://www.example.com' \\\n    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    --data '{\n        \"version\": \"1.0\",\n        \"workflow_delay\": \"15\",\n        \"workflow_name\": \"Escalation Reminder\",\n        \"workflow_message_ts\": \"1669086095.123456\",\n        \"workflow_message_text\": \"This is the message that triggered the workflow.\",\n        \"workflow_message_url\": \"https://clearfeed.slack.com/archives/C0ABCD123/p1669086095123456\",\n        \"workflow_message_author_id\": \"U12345\",\n        \"workflow_message_author_name\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"request_id\": 123,\n        \"request_state\": \"Open\",\n        \"request_title\": \"Need assistance with XYZ\",\n        \"request_priority\": \"high\",\n        \"request_thread_ts\": \"1669086095.987654\",\n        \"request_thread_url\": \"https://clearfeed.slack.com/archives/C0ABCD123/p1691040592308569?thread_ts=1669086095.987654\",\n        \"request_channel_id\": \"C0ABCD123\",\n        \"request_channel_name\": \"clearfeed_swiftcorp_solutions\",\n        \"request_collection_id\": 123,\n        \"request_collection_name\": \"Premium Customer Channels\"\n    }'\n\n**Zapier** \\- To use webhook action workflow with Zapier, use the Zapier\nendpoint URL as the webhook URL. Verify the webhook action before establishing\nthe Zapier connection. Use the provided payload for configuration.\n\n##\n\nCommitments\n\nClearFeed uses AI to automatically find commitments in responder messages.\n\n###\n\nHow it works?\n\n  * The system will automatically analyze the response from the responders to see if they have made any commitments.\n\n  * For example, if the support team says \"_We're working on it and will get back to you as soon as it's fixed_ ,\" the system will track this as a commitment and classify the request as `Pending on you` status internally.\n\n  * A reminder is sent exactly 24 hours after the commitment message is sent.\n\n  * The external state of the request will be `In Progress`\n\n###\n\nExample Messages\n\n  *  _Let me check with the team and let you know_\n\n  *  _Will update once there are finer notes on the implementation_\n\n  *  _Suspecting a possible bug here, I'll have to check with the engineering team and confirm_\n\n  *  _Yes, that makes sense. Let us look into this point for the threaded messages_\n\nThese workflows are enabled automatically for all requests. Here's what a\ncommitment reminder on the triage channel looks like:\n\nOnce there is a response from the responder/support on the request, this\nreminder will be dismissed automatically since the commitment was fulfilled.\n\n"

Filing Linear issues against requests\n\n##\n\nIntegrate Linear\n\nOnly Linear Workspace Admins can approve ClearFeed integration access.\n\n  1. Head over to Account Settings (Gear icon in the lower left) -> Integration Tab\n\n  2. Press the `Connect` against Linear\n\n  3. You will be prompted to log in to Linear (If you've already not logged in)\n\n  4. Approve the authorization flow on Linear by selecting the `Authorize` button.\n\n  5. You will be successfully redirected to ClearFeed with a success message\n\n##\n\nEnable Ticketing\n\n  1. Go to [web.clearfeed.app/collections](http://web.clearfeed.app/collections)\n\n  2. Choose the required collection from the list on the left-hand panel\n\n  3. Click on **Settings** and then choose **Ticketing Settings**\n\n  4. Choose **Linear** as the Ticketing Integration\n\n  5. Choose the trigger mode (Emoji/Automatic)\n\n     * If it is an emoji-based creation, choose the emoji that should trigger ticket creation (default is \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f emoji).\n\n  6. Click on the \u2699\ufe0f icon to open Additional Settings where you would need to select a Linear team. Issues created using ClearFeed will be tied to this team.\n\n##\n\nCreate Tickets\n\n###\n\nManually using Emoji\n\nUsing Emoji\n\n  1. A conversation is initiated on the request channel.\n\n  2. React to the first message on the thread using the \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f emoji.\n\n  3. A Linear ticket is created for the thread. All messages in the thread (along with the attachments) are synced to the ticket.\n\n###\n\nAutomatically\n\nAuto-create tickets\n\n  1. Every new conversation (Slack thread) that is initiated on the request channel gets converted into a Linear ticket automatically.\n\n  2. As soon as the ticket conversation occurs, ClearFeed posts a message on the Slack thread sharing the Linear ticket details.\n\n###\n\nFrom Triage channel\n\nCreating from Triage channel\n\nRequests in the Triage channel can be easily converted to Linear issues using\nthe `More Actions` button. Follow the below steps to do so:\n\n  1. For any request on the Triage channel, click on the `More Actions` button.\n\n  2. This will open a modal. Here, select the `File a Linear issue` option and proceed.\n\n  3. This successfully converts the request into a Linear issue.\n\nThe corresponding request channel thread on Slack now displays the `title`,\n`ID`, and `Status` of the Linear issue.\n\n##\n\nFunctionalities\n\n  1. Replies on the Slack thread and the Linear ticket are synced bidirectionally.\n\n  2. The corresponding request channel thread on Slack now displays the `Title`, `ID`, and `Status` of the Linear Ticket. Status changes on Linear are reflected on Slack.\n\n  3. ClearFeed adds the following labels to the Linear ticket: `Slack channel name`, `clearfeed`\n\n  4. Public comments from the triage channel are also synced back to the Linear ticket.\n\n  5. Status change updates are also posted on the thread when the Linear ticket is moved to `Done` state.\n\nIf you use Linear ticketing to support customers on Slack-Connect channels,\nClearFeed does not post Linear issue details or status updates back to the\ncustomer channel.\n\n##\n\nSync Settings\n\nSync settings allow you to choose whether messages are synced bidirectionally\nor in a single direction. Additionally, you can decide if updates to the\nlinked ticket's status are shared in the Slack thread.\n\n###\n\nFor all Tickets\n\nTo configure common sync settings for all new tickets - follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n  1. Access Sync Settings by navigating to [**Objects**](https://web.clearfeed.app/objects/linear)\n\n  2. Choose your **Message Sync Mode**\n\n  3. Select whether status updates are shared in the **Status Sync Mode** setting\n\n###\n\nFor Individual Tickets\n\nYou can also configure different sync settings for individual tickets. Once a\nticket is created from Slack, access the three-dot menu (shown in the\nillustration below) and configure your settings.\n\nOnly Responders can configure Sync Settings for individual tickets from the\nrequest channel in Slack\n\n###\n\nMessage Sync Mode\n\nDetermines how messages are synced between Slack and Linear.\n\n  * **2-way sync between Linear and Slack thread:** Replies from Slack are posted on Linear, and comments from Linear are synced to Slack.\n\n  * **Only forward sync from Slack thread to Linear:** Replies from Slack are posted on Linear, but comments from Linear are not posted back on Slack.\n\n  * **Only backward sync from Linear to Slack thread:** Only Linear comments are posted on Slack, and replies from Slack do not go to Linear.\n\n  * **No sync between Linear and Slack thread:** No comments are synced from Slack or Linear.\n\n###\n\nStatus Sync Mode\n\nDetermine whether status updates are shared on the request channel thread on\nSlack or not.\n\nUpdates are only delivered when the status is changed to \"Solved\" or moved to\n\"Open\" from \"Solved\"\n\n  * **Sync key status changes from Linear to Slack thread:** Whenever the ticket is \"Solved\" or moved to \"Open\" from \"Solved - the updates are shared on Slack.\n\n  * **No sync of status changes from Linear to the Slack thread:** No status updates are synced to Slack.\n\n##\n\nEscalating to Linear\n\nIf you're using ClearFeed as a native helpdesk but want to escalate issues to\nLinear, follow the guide below:\n\n[Escalating to Linear](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/linear/escalating-\nto-linear)\n\n[PreviousEscalating to Jira](/clearfeed-help-\ncenter/integrations/jira/escalating-to-jira)[NextEscalating to\nLinear](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/linear/escalating-to-linear)\n\nLast updated 1 month ago\n\n"

Customize these based on your needs.\n\n    * **Root URL:** Enter the main URL from which ClearFeed will start indexing. URLs that do not branch out from this main URL will not be considered. For example, if the Root URL is __[_https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/product-features/ticketing_](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/product-features/ticketing), then URLs like [_https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/product-features/collections_](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/product-features/collections) __ won't be indexed.\n\n    * **URL Conditions** : Specify the conditions for what URLs to index.

Here, resolution means marking the request as `Solved`. It accounts for the entire lifecycle of a request, from initiation to resolution, capturing changes in status due to reopening, which affects the overall time taken for resolution.\n\n    * **Note:** If a request was solved and later re-opened, it is not considered for calculating resolution time.\n\n  * **Exclusions**\n\n    * Requests which were initiated, but **don't** have Status _=_`Solved/Closed` currently will not be included in the metric computation. Request with Status = `Open`, `In Progress`, `On Hold`, or `Pending` will not be considered to calculate this metric. \n\n      * Example: If there are a total of 10 requests initiated in the selected duration, and only 8 have been marked as `Solved/Closed`, then only 8 requests will be used for computation. \n\n    * Messages which are not a request are not considered in this metric.\n\n  * **Reporting Unit** \\- Average Time (in Minutes) \n\n  * **Calculation -** If ten requests are raised, and five of them are marked as `Solved`. And, if all five requests were solved in ten minutes, the closure time for these five requests would be ten minutes.\n\n  * **Impact of Business Hours** \\- Any time gap in the `resolution time` that falls outside of the business hours is not counted in the calculation \n\n    * **Example**\n\n      * The business schedule is 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM \n\n      * The request comes at 8:00 AM \n\n      * The request is solved the next day at 9:30 AM\n\n      * `Resolution time` will be 8 hr 30 mins = (5 PM - 9 AM) + (9:30AM - 9 AM) \n\n##\n\nFirst Resolution Time\n\n  * **Definition** \\- Average time duration between the creation of a request and when it is marked as solved (i.e. the request is resolved) for the **first time.** It serves as the metric to give an estimate of how quickly the first resolution of a request occurs. \n\n    * This includes all requests which were resolved at least once. Any requests which have not been resolved at all will not be considered. \n\n    * If a request's state changes after resolution, it does not affect the first resolution time. That is if a request is Marked as Solved but its status is shifted back to `Open`, `In Progress`, `Pending`, `On-Hold`, or `Closed` it won't affect the first resolution time metric. \n\n    * **Example:** Consider 5 requests are created at 10:00 AM. \n\n      * Out of these 5 requests, 3 requests are marked as solved after 5, 10, and 15 minutes post-creation respectively. \n\n      * Then, the First Resolution Time would be (5+10+15)/3 = 10 minutes.\n\n  * **Exclusions -** Requests that haven't been marked as solved at least once will not be factored into this metric's computation. In the example given above, only the three requests that were marked as solved were considered for the calculation.\n\n  * **Reporting Unit -** Average in minutes.\n\n  * **Impact of Business Hours -** Any time gap falling outside of the business hours while computing the First Resolution time is not considered in the calculation. \n\n    * **Example:**\n\n      * Consider the business hours for an organization are 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. \n\n      * A request is created at 8:00 AM and it is marked as solved for the first time at 10:30 AM. \n\n      * The First Resolution time in such a case would be 30 minutes (10 AM - 10:30 AM). \n\n  * **Requests with Tickets -** Turn on the 'Requests with Tickets' toggle to view insights specifically for the tickets in that account.\n\n##\n\nAverage CSAT Score\n\n  * **Definition** \\- This metric reflects the average of CSAT scores, ranging from 1 (low satisfaction) to 5 (high satisfaction), provided by requesters after their request/ticket is moved to the 'solved' state.\n\n    * **Example** \\- If three requesters give CSAT scores of 1, 3, and 5, the average score will be calculated as (1+3+5)/3 = 3\n\n  * **Exclusions** \\- In instances where the responders have not provided any CSAT scores, the metric is designated as \"N/A\" (Not Available). This ensures that the average is only calculated from actual data. \n\n  * **Reporting Unit:** Average Score\n\n  * **Requests with Tickets -** Turn on the 'Requests with Tickets' toggle to view insights specifically for the tickets in that account.\n\n##\n\n**% of First Response SLA Breached**\n\n  * **Definition -** Percentage of requests that breached the first response SLA configured in the [SLA policies](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/sla-management)\n\n    * **Logic -** No. of requests violating First Response SLA in a given time / Total number of requests in a given time\n\n    * It is mandatory to have SLAs set up to be able to use this metric \n\n  * **Calculation -** If ten requests were raised today that have had a first response and six of them breached the first response time (considering business hours), the percentage here will be 60%\n\n  * **Reporting Unit** \\- Percentage (%)\n\n  * **Impact of Business Hours** \\- Any first response time gap that falls outside of the business hours is not considered a breach \n\n    * **Example**\n\n      * First Response SLA Policy - 60 mins \n\n      * The business hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM \n\n      * The request comes at 8:00 AM \n\n      * The request was responded to at 9:30 AM\n\n      * The First Response Time will be 30 mins = (9:30 AM - 9 AM) \n\n      * This will not be considered a breach\n\n##\n\n**% of Resolution Time SLA Breached**\n\n  * **Definition -** Percentage of requests that breached the Resolution Time SLA configured in the [SLA policies](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/sla-management)\n\n    * **Logic -** No. of requests violating Resolution Time SLA in a given time / total number of requests that are closed in a given time\n\n    * It is mandatory to have SLAs set up to be able to use this metric \n\n  * **Exclusion -** Messages that are not a request are not considered in this metric.\n\n  * **Calculation -** If ten requests were raised today which were resolved and six of them breached the resolution time SLA policy (considering business hours), the percentage of breaches here will be 60%\n\n  * **Reporting Unit** \\- Percentage (%)\n\n  * **Impact of Business Hours** \\- Any resolution time gap that falls outside of the business hours is not considered a breach \n\n    * **Example**\n\n      * Resolution Time SLA Policy - 120 minutes\n\n      * The business hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM \n\n      * The request comes at 8:00 AM \n\n      * The request was resolved at 10:30 AM\n\n      * Resolution Time will be 90 mins = (9 AM to 10:30 AM) \n\n      * This will not be considered a breach\n\n##\n\n**% One Touch Resolution Breached**\n\n  * **Definition -** Percentage of requests that breached the One Touch SLA (eg. 2 replies) configured in the [SLA policies](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/sla-management)\n\n    * **Logic -** No. of tickets violating one-touch resolution SLA in a given time / Total No. of closed requests in a given time\n\n    * It is mandatory to have SLAs set up to be able to use this metric \n\n  * **Exclusion** \\- Messages that are not a request are not considered in this metric.\n\n  * **Calculation -** If ten requests were solved today and six of them had more than configured responses (for one touch), the percentage of breaches here will be 60%.\n\n  * **Reporting Unit** \\- Percentage (%)\n\n  * **Impact of Business Hours** \\- No Impact\n\n[PreviousReporting Overview](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-\nhelpdesk/reporting/reporting-overview)[NextMetrics Definitions - Virtual\nAgent](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/reporting/metrics-\ndefinitions-virtual-agent)\n\nLast updated 4 months ago\n\n"

We will post\nthe progress here as we get better visibility.\n\nBut you can safely install the ClearFeed App on your Slack Workspace. The\nfollowing section details an overview of Security on ClearFeed.\n\n###\n\n**Overview of Security on ClearFeed:**\n\n####\n\nInfrastructure Security\n\n  * Our infrastructure is hosted on AWS in the `us-east-1 `region across three availability zones.\n\n  * By default, we block all traffic at a network level and only open specific ports as required to deliver the ClearFeed service.\n\n  * Any escalated access to infrastructure requires a VPN or a whitelisted IP with 2-factor authentication.\n\n  * We use AWS GuardDuty to detect unusual traffic and unauthenticated access to our critical systems.\n\n  * Host-based intrusion detection systems are in active use.\n\n####\n\nData Encryption\n\n  * All critical data that we store is encrypted at rest and in transit.\n\n####\n\nFailover and disaster recovery\n\n  * All of our production infrastructure is built with redundancies in place, in highly-available configurations spread over three different availability zones in the us-east-1 AWS region.\n\n  * We have a disaster recovery plan which is reviewed every 6 months and a tabletop exercise is conducted by the management to verify that the plan is up to date.\n\n####\n\nInventory and configuration\n\n  * Infrastructure is kept as code using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and other infrastructure-as-code tools with changes going through a process very similar to the application-level software development process. We make use of separate infrastructure for development, staging, and live environments, with no sharing of data between environments.\n\n####\n\nIdentity and Access Control\n\n  * Access to all of our critical systems requires 2FA authentication to sign in.\n\n  * Access to customer data is limited to authorized employees who require it for operational and maintenance activities.\n\n  * Access to sensitive production data is limited to just the DevOps team.\n\n####\n\nMonitoring and logging\n\n  * We do extensive monitoring of infrastructure and application performance, which usually allows us to detect issues before many customers experience them.\n\n  * Automated alerts are set up with the help of [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). All alerts are acknowledged within 10 minutes.\n\n####\n\nPenetration Testing\n\n  * We perform annual application-level penetration tests via an independent third party.\n\n  * We aim to fix any discovered critical issues within 2 business days, and high-severity issues within 30 business days.\n\n  * Medium-severity and lower-severity issues are handled as part of ongoing security work.\n\n  * Please email [security@clearfeed.ai](mailto:security@clearfeed.ai) to get a copy of our penetration testing report.\n\n####\n\nIncident response\n\n  * ClearFeed implements a protocol for handling security events and other operational issues, including escalation procedures, rapid mitigation, and post-mortems.\n\n  * You can visit our [status page](https://clearfeed.statuspage.io/) to get updates on potential issues, and even subscribe to automatic updates.\n\n**User Consent**\n\n  * We rigorously adhere to GDPR requirements, ensuring that all data processing activities meet the highest standards of security, transparency, and user consent mandated by EU regulations.\n\n  * We obtain explicit consent from users before utilizing cookies, ensuring full compliance with GDPR guidelines.\n\n####\n\nCompliance\n\n  * ClearFeed is SOC2 Type 2 compliant and GDPR compliant. \n\n  * To get a copy of our SOC2 compliance report, please email [security@clearfeed.ai](mailto:security@clearfeed.ai).\n\n####\n\nData retention\n\n  * By Default, ClearFeed stores Slack message data for 60 days (excluding attachments), deleting raw messages after this period. Metadata and perpetual statistics like response times are retained. You can edit the data retention policy\n\n  * You can read more about data retention and how to set custom policies from the ClearFeed web app: [Data Retention Policy and Settings](/clearfeed-help-center/account-settings/data-retention-policy#data-retention-policy-and-settings)\n\n####\n\n**Terms of Service, Privacy Policies and DPA**\n\n  * Our standard policies are listed on our public website:\n\n    * **Terms of Service** \\- <https://clearfeed.ai/tos>\n\n    * **Privacy Policy** \\- <https://clearfeed.ai/privacy-policy>\n\n    * **DPA:** <https://clearfeed.ai/dpa>\n\n  * All our Enterprise product editions support customer DPA, Terms of Service, and Security Reviews.

Add a [**Triage channel** ](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels)for the support team to work from on Slack\n\n     * You can select `Create new channel` or `Select existing` option\n\n     * Your support team can also work directly from Request channels, in which case you can opt in `Proceed without triage`\n\n  6. Under **Ticketing** , select ClearFeed ticketing and choose the trigger mode for ticket creation\n\n     * Trigger mode for the ticket can be an emoji (eg. \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f) applied to the thread or tickets can be auto-created on every new message on the request channel \n\n  7. You can edit an existing [workflow](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/workflows) to send a notification to the corresponding triage channel if there is no response to a request for 60 mins\n\n###\n\n**Add Knowledge Source**\n\n  1. In the Clearfeed dashboard, go to the 'Answers' section in the left navigation bar and click on the 'Add Knowledge Source' button.\n\n  2. You can add Knowledge Sources from the following options - \n\n     * [Public](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/indexing-knowledge-sources/public)\n\n     * [Confluence](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/indexing-knowledge-sources/confluence)\n\n     * [Freshdesk](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/indexing-knowledge-sources/freshdesk)\n\n     * [Zendesk](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/indexing-knowledge-sources/zendesk)\n\n     * [Notion](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/clearfeed-help-center/)\n\n     * [Slack](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/indexing-knowledge-sources/slack-channels)\n\n  3. The Knowledge Source will either start indexing immediately (reflected by an Indexing status) or will be picked soon (reflected with an Initiated status). Get more details on Managing Knowledge Sources [here](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/managing-knowledge-sources). \n\n###\n\nTesting Answers\n\nConfirm that all necessary Knowledge Sources are added and their current\nstatus is **Indexed**. You **cannot** test a Knowledge Source having any other\nstatus.\n\n  1. Navigate to [Answers](https://web.clearfeed.app/knowledge-sources) from the navigation bar and click on the `Test` tab to enter the testing environment.\n\n  2. Use the dropdown menu on the right to select the appropriate tags for the Knowledge Sources you want to test.\n\n  3. Enter your question into the text box and click the \"Run\" button to begin the test.\n\n  4. The generated answer and the search results (snippets) will be displayed in a text box below your question.\n\n###\n\n**Collection Settings**\n\n  1. After adding the knowledge sources, go to the Collection Settings of the desired collection to enable 'Answers.'\n\n  2. Once the 'Answers' toggle is enabled, select from the following options: -\n\n     * [Virtual Agent](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/virtual-agent-in-request-channel) \\- Virtual Agent responses are visible to the requester as well as responders.\n\n     * [Agent Assistant](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/virtual-agent-in-request-channel#using-the-agent-assistant-on-the-triage-channel) \\- Agent Assistant responses are visible only to responders.\n\n  3. Select and add the appropriate Knowledge Source from the dropdown menu.\n\n  4. After saving the configuration, you are all set to use GPT Powered Answers. \n\n###\n\n**Try on Slack Channel**\n\n  1. A request is received on the request channel.\n\n  2. This triggers the _Virtual Agent_ , which starts searching within your indexed Knowledge Sources for snippets containing information pertaining to the request.\n\n  3. On finding the snippets, the _Virtual Agent_ responds to the request. If the answering mode configured for this request channel's Collection is:\n\n     * `Search Results`: The _Virtual Agent_ simply posts these snippets (as _Search Results_) in a threaded reply to the request.\n\n     * `Generated Answers and Search Results`: The _Virtual Agent_ uses GPT to generate an answer using the most relevant snippet. Then, it posts this Generated Answer _,_ along with the snippets (_as Search Results_)__ in a threaded reply to the request.\n\n  4. A feedback question is present at the footer of the posted answer.\n\n  5. If the answer is**helpful,** users****(requesters/responders)**** can click on the `Yes, mark as solved` button and **solve** the request. Else, if users **do not** find the answer **helpful,** they should click on the `No` button. This marks the answer as _not helpful_ and keeps the request **open.**\n\n  6.

Eg. there automatically get dismissed in case the messages are replied. This is not the case with notifications triggered via automation. \n\n  * Automated reply on request or ticket creation. These messages can be dismissed by users on Slack. \n\n  1. **How does ClearFeed check for invariance of triggers and conditions during the delay period in automation?**\n\n**Ans:** During the delay period in automation, ClearFeed checks for the\ninvariance of the \"status\" property only. For all other properties defined in\nthe automation, the trigger and conditions are evaluated only at the time of\nthe initial trigger. This means that changes to properties other than \"status\"\nduring the delay period do not affect the automation's execution.\n\n"

        "text": "##\n\nConfiguring Forms\n\nEach Zendesk Form has two parts - _**When creating a ticket**_ __ and _**When\nediting a ticket**_ _._\n\n  * Navigate to [**Objects**](https://web.clearfeed.app/objects/clearfeed)**** on the ClearFeed web console, toggle Zendesk Ticketing under Objects, and click on **Add Form** -> **Create from Scratch.**\n\n  * Provide a suitable name for the form (the Form name will be visible to the requestors when creating the ticket).\n\n###\n\n_Create_ Form\n\n  1.  _Requestor Email, Subject,_ and _Description_ fields are added to the Form by default.\n\n     * These properties are _Pre-filled_ by ClearFeed (that means, a value is assigned to these fields when a ticket is created).\n\n  2. From the Zendesk Fields table - add the fields you want to be a part of the form.\n\n  3. Configure properties such as making fields optional, setting a default value, or hiding a field.\n\n     * Learn more about field properties [**here**](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/zendesk/forms#field-properties).\n\n  4. Save your configuration and move on to [configure the Edit Action form](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/zendesk/forms#configure-the-zendesk-edit-action-form) (optional).\n\nFields added in the _Create_ form will be visible to responders on the triage\nchannel when working on tickets.\n\n###\n\n_Edit_ Form\n\nIf the Edit Form is enabled - users will see an Edit Ticket button when they\ncreate a ticket. You can provide requestors and responders the exclusive\nability to modify fields after ticket creation.\n\nOnly the fields that are a part of the _Edit form_ can be modified from the\ntriage channel after a ticket is created.\n\n  1. Add fields from the `Zendesk Fields` table available on the right-hand side.\n\n  2. Configure properties such as making fields optional, setting a default value, or hiding a field.\n\n     * Learn more about field properties [**here**](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/zendesk/forms#field-properties).\n\n**Pro tip:** Use the **Add all Create Form fields** button to quickly add\nfields that are a part of the _Create_ form to the _Edit_ form.\n\n###\n\n**Ticket Creation Without a Form**\n\n  * If all fields in a form are hidden, both responders and requesters will be able to create a ticket without filling out a form.\n\n    * Responders would still be able to enter a requestor email ID. \n\n  * If all fields in a Form are set to be editable by _only responders_ , requesters will be able to create a ticket without filling out a form.\n\n    * **Note** : In both cases, the pre-filled or default value of fields will be populated.\n\n##\n\nField Properties\n\nIf you use distinct field names for Agents and Customers in Zendesk, Clearfeed\nwill display distinct fields for Agents and Customers, as configured in\nZendesk.\n\n  * **Removing Fields:** Remove fields from a Form using the Delete icon.\n\n    * **Note:**_Requestor Email, Subject,_ and _Description_ are non-removable in the _Create Action_ form. However, they can be hidden to prevent modification.\n\n  * **Reordering Fields:** To customize the order of the fields, click and hold a field in the left column, then drag and drop it to your desired position in the sequence.\n\n    * **Note:** Non-removable fields will always be on top, while hidden fields will automatically move to the bottom once the changes are saved.\n\n  * **Non-responder Field Label:** This determines the field name that would be displayed to the requestors when they use the form. \n\n    * This information is pulled directly from Zendesk where you set the Title shown to customers. You can read more about the same [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408883152794-Adding-custom-fields-to-your-tickets-and-support-request-form#:~:text=custom%20fields\\).-,Creating%20custom%20ticket%20fields,-You%20can%20add). \n\n  * **Placeholder Text:** The text that is shown inside the field before users enter their information.\n\n  * **Hint Text:** The hint text that is shown below the field to guide users on what to enter. Think of this as the field description.\n\n  * **Default Values:** Adds default values to the fields. Default values automatically populate the corresponding Zendesk fields when a ticket is created.\n\n    * **Note** : Default values cannot be entered for non-removable fields.\n\n  * **Hidden Fields:** To ensure specific fields are not modified during ticket creation, you can hide them from the _Create Action_ Form.\n\n    * **Note** : When hiding a field, it is mandatory to assign a default value to it.\n\n  * **Permissions:** Specify who is required to fill a given field when creating or editing a ticket using the **Editable by** column. Choose between _All users_ or _Only responders_.\n\n    * **Note** : Only users with the specified permission for a field will see it in the form when creating a ticket on Slack. However, they must mandatorily fill it to proceed.\n\n  * **Required Field** : Specify if the field is optional or mandatory when creating or editing a ticket in the `Required field` column.\n\n    * **Note:** By default, the 'Required field' value corresponds to the Zendesk Required field setting. If a field is marked as required in Zendesk, it will automatically be set to 'Required'.\n\n##\n\nImporting Zendesk Forms\n\nZendesk should be integrated with ClearFeed to make these forms visible. Learn\nhow to integrate with Zendesk here.\n\n  1. You would need existing forms created on Zendesk that can be imported.\n\n  2. Make sure the Forms that you want to import are set as Active in Zendesk.\n\n  1. Hover over the `Add Form` button, and you will notice an option to `Import from Zendesk`.\n\n  2. Under the Select Form dropdown, you will notice all the active forms on Zendesk.\n\n  3. Select the form that you want to import into ClearFeed and click on `Import Form`.\n\n  4. Once the Zendesk Form is imported, you can configure the _Create_ and _Edit_ action forms by following the steps mentioned:\n\n     * [Configure the form for creating a ticket](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/zendesk/forms#configure-the-zendesk-create-action-form)\n\n     * [Configure the form for editing a ticket](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/zendesk/forms#configure-the-zendesk-edit-action-form)\n\n  5. Once the forms are configured, click on `Save`\n\n##\n\nMapping Forms to Collection\n\nBy default, all active Zendesk Forms are available for ticket creation in\nCollections with Zendesk ticketing enabled. However, you can map specific\nForms to a Collection to restrict the available Forms for ticket creation.\n\nZendesk Ticketing needs to be enabled for a Collection.\n\n  * Only Forms with an active [_Create Action_](/clearfeed-help-center/integrations/zendesk/forms#configure-the-zendesk-create-action-form) Form will be available for mapping.\n\n  * A form can be mapped to multiple collections.\n\n####\n\nHow to map form to a Collection?\n\n  1. Navigate to `Collections -> Settings`.\n\n  2. Go to `Ticketing Settings`.\n\n  3. In the Forms Availability section, select the `Specific Forms` option.\n\n  4. From the available Forms, select the ones you'd like to associate with this Collection.\n\n##\n\nScreens\n\nWhen requests are turned into Zendesk tickets, details are sent back to the\nrequester in a designated ticket message block on the request channel.\n\n  * The screens section lets you customize the ticket message shown to the requester. You can show or hide ticket fields and manage the ticket resolution button.\n\nTo configure the ticket message for Zendesk ticketing, follow the steps given\nbelow:\n\n  1. Head over to the `Objects` section on the ClearFeed web application -> <https://web.clearfeed.app/objects>\n\n  2. Under the ticketing drop-down, select `Zendesk Ticketing`.\n\n  3. Select `Screens` from the tabs mentioned under Zendesk Ticketing.\n\n###\n\nFields:\n\n  * **Status** \\- By default, the Status of the Zendesk ticket is always shown to the requester. This cannot be configured to be hidden.\n\n    * Note: Custom Zendesk statuses are also supported.\n\n  * **Priority** \\- The priority of the ticket can be shown to the requester using this field. The priority of the ticket will be pulled directly from Zendesk.\n\n  * **Ticket URL -** Allows you to show or hide the Zendesk ticket URL to the requestor.\n\n    * Showing the URL is advisable if you have the Help Center enabled for your customers.\n\n  * **Form Name -** Name of the Form used to create the ticket.\n\n    * Note: Form name appears only if there is more than one form in the account.\n\n  * **Fields populated by Create Form -** Only non-empty, non-hidden fields, marked as editable by 'All' in the 'Create Form', will be displayed in the message.\n\n  * **Fields populated by Edit Form -** Only non-empty, non-hidden fields, marked as editable by 'All' in the 'Edit Form', will be displayed in the message.\n\n###\n\nActions:\n\n  1. _**Mark As Solved**_ button: You can choose to expose the `Mark as Solved` button which allows responders/requesters to solve a ticket right from the request channel.\n\n     * Check the option to display the `Mark as Solved` button on the ticket message block.\n\n       * **Permissions:** `All` or `Responder`.\n\n         * `All` \\- Allows access to the `Mark as Solved` button to both the requester and responder\n\n         * `Responder` \\- Only agents/responders will be able to use the `Mark as Solved` action to resolve tickets.\n\n  2. _**Edit Ticket**_ __ button: The Edit ticket button will be present on the ticket message by default whenever the Edit action Form is enabled.\n\n     * Disabling a Parent Form (or its underlying _Edit_ action form) will disable the editing feature for existing tickets created using it and the `Edit Ticket` button will be hidden from all new tickets created using the Form.\n\n##\n\nFAQs\n\n  1. **Which Zendesk field types are supported by ClearFeed?**\n\n**Answer:** ClearFeed currently supports only specific Zendesk field types:\nText, Multi-line, Drop-down, Multi-select, Checkbox, Number, and Date. More\ntypes will be supported soon to enhance functionality.\n\nThe unsupported fields are flagged with a warning that indicates such fields\ncannot be added to the Form.\n\n  1. **What is the Default Zendesk Ticket Form and can I modify it?**\n\n**Answer:** The Default Zendesk Ticket Form is pre-built with your ClearFeed\naccount. By default, it doesn't show any fields when creating a ticket.\nHowever, you can customize this form and add the specific fields you need to\nfit your purposes.\n\n  1. **Can all Create action forms in ClearFeed be disabled?**\n\n**Answer:** The Create action form is enabled by default and cannot be\ndisabled unless you create a new form with its Create action enabled. It is\nmandatory to have at least one form with an enabled Create action at all times\nto ensure seamless ticket creation.\n\n  1. **What happens if all fields in a form are hidden?**\n\n**Answer:** If all fields in a form are hidden, both responders and requesters\ncan create a ticket without filling out a form. The pre-filled or default\nvalues of the fields will automatically be populated in the ClearFeed ticket.\n\n  1. **Does ClearFeed automatically capture the placeholder text, hint text, and field alias for fields that are a part of the Create action form to the Edit form?**\n\n**Answer:** Yes - once you set up your Create action form - move to the Edit\nform and click on the button that says `+ Add all Create form fields`. That\nshould copy all fields and the relevant properties.\n\nIf you have existing fields set up in the Edit form - removing them and re-\nadding would also copy all properties from the Create form.\n\n  1. **Can requesters create a ticket without filling out a form if all fields are editable only by responders?**\n\n**Answer:** Yes, if all fields in a form are set to be editable by only\nresponders, requesters can still create a ticket without filling out a form.\nThe pre-filled or default values of the fields will be populated in the\nClearFeed ticket.\n\n  1. **Will the pre-filled or default values be used if the form fields are hidden or set to be editable only by responders?**\n\n**Answer:** Yes, in both cases\u2014whether the form fields are hidden or set to be\neditable only by responders\u2014the pre-filled or default values of the fields\nwill be used in the ClearFeed ticket.\n\n  1. **Is it necessary for responders to fill out the form if the fields are hidden or set to be editable only by them?**\n\n**Answer:** No, responders don't need to fill out the form in these scenarios.\nThe ticket creation process will rely on the pre-filled or default values of\nthe fields.\n\n  1. **What happens if the Parent Form or its Edit action is inactive?**\n\n**Answer:** If the Parent Form used for creating a ticket, or its underlying\nEdit action, is inactive, you will be unable to edit existing tickets that\nwere filed through that Form.\n\n  1. **What happens if all fields in an Edit Form are hidden when responders and requesters click the Edit ticket button?**\n\n**Answer:** If all fields in an Edit Form are hidden, clicking the Edit ticket\nbutton will update the respective default values of the ClearFeed ticket\nfields without showing any form on Slack.\n\n  1. **What happens when fields are removed from the parent Zendesk form?**\n\n**Answer:** Removed fields are automatically deleted from both the Create and\nEdit forms in ClearFeed and are no longer selectable for future\nconfigurations. However, the original fields remain accessible when editing\nexisting tickets.\n\n  1. **What occurs when fields are added to the parent Zendesk form?**\n\n**Answer:** Newly added fields become available for selection in the imported\nform on ClearFeed, allowing you to include them as needed. Additions to the\nEdit form won't reflect on previously created tickets.\n\n  1. **Will newly added fields in the Zendesk form be available for editing existing tickets?**\n\n**Answer:** No, users will see only the original set of fields when editing\nexisting tickets.\n\n  1. **How does ClearFeed ensure synchronization with the parent Zendesk form?**\n\n**Answer:** ClearFeed automatically updates the imported forms to match\nchanges in the parent Zendesk form, adding or removing fields as necessary to\nmaintain synchronization.\n\n"

(Optional) Configure a workflow to help you get alerts.\n\nFor the _Internal Helpdesk_ product edition - the ticketing integration cannot\nbe modified and is set to **ClearFeed** by default.\n\nCreating a DM Collection is only supported in the main ClearFeed account.\nChild accounts do not have their dedicated DM collection - however, you can\nstill create tickets for these accounts with the help of [**Request\nRouting**](/clearfeed-help-center/create-requests/using-clearfeed-slack-\napp#request-routing).\n\n###\n\nRequest Routing\n\nBy default - tickets created via the ClearFeed Slack App are stored in the\nSlack App DM collection. However - you can enable Request Routing which helps\nusers select a specific collection for their tickets.\n\nEnabling **Request Routing** is mandatory to create tickets using the /\ncommand shortcut and the \"File ticket\" button.\n\n####\n\nLook how to enable Request Routing below:\n\n###\n\nHow does Request Routing work?\n\nRequest Routing enables you to route tickets created via the ClearFeed Slack\nApp to different collections across multiple ClearFeed accounts.\n\nSettings of the selected Collection are applied to the filed ticket.\n\nFor example, if a triage channel is configured for the chosen Collection - the\nfiled ticket will end up in the chosen triage channel.\n\n####\n\nUse Case 1: Single ClearFeed Account + Multiple Collections\n\n  * Type your request in the `Messages` section on the ClearFeed Slack App.\n\n  * From the drop-down, select the Collection where the ticket should be routed.\n\n  * (If forms are configured) - Select the Form to be used for filing the ticket.\n\n####\n\nUse Case 2: Multiple Accounts + Multiple Collections\n\n##\n\nDM the ClearFeed App\n\nCreating tickets from the ClearFeed Slack App is very simple. Users can\nmessage the app to create the tickets.\n\n  * Go to the ClearFeed App from your Slack App drawer\n\n  * Click on the `Messages` section\n\n  * Type a message and send it.\n\nThese tickets are _**private**_ \\- i.e. not visible to other requesters. This\nis generally useful in cases where you want your users to create tickets that\ncontain sensitive information.\n\nCommon use cases: HR, Finance, Payroll, People/Culture teams, etc...\n\nThese requests are visible at the following places:\n\n  * Dedicated collection on the ClearFeed Web App\n\n  * Triage channel (if configured)\n\n  * ClearFeed Slack App Homepage\n\n##\n\nFile a Ticket Button\n\n**Request Routing** must be enabled in your DM Collection to create tickets\nusing the File a Ticket button. Learn how to do that [**here**](/clearfeed-\nhelp-center/create-requests/using-clearfeed-slack-app#request-routing).\n\nUsers can easily create a ticket without sending any message using the **File\na Ticket** button.\n\n####\n\nHow do you create and track tickets using the File a Ticket button?\n\n  1. Navigate to the ClearFeed Slack App. \n\n  2. Click on `File a ticket` button\n\n  3. You will see a dropdown of all available Forms, grouped by the Collections they're linked to. \n\n  4. Select the relevant Form. \n\n  5. Enter the details and your ticket will be created\n\n  6. You can track and update the created ticket from the **Messages** section in the ClearFeed Slack App or under the [My Tickets](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/clearfeed-slack-app#my-tickets-for-requesters) view. \n\n  7. Replies from agents would also land in the same thread.\n\nOnly ClearFeed and Zendesk ticketing are currently supported by this method.\nIf you want support for other ticketing integrations, please notify us at\nsupport@clearfeed.ai.\n\n"

Expand this section to learn more.\n\n  * Messages by a user in rapid succession (Most common): We use a really small threshold (5 min) to club multiple messages by the same user into the same request.\n\n    * **Note:** This is not applicable in cases where integrations with automatic ticketing are used. \n\n  * A message is a continuation of a previous one (e.g.: \"absolutely!\") that is merged into the previous request.\n\n  * A message that refers to a previous one (e.g.: \"see above ^^\") is merged into the previous request.\n\n  * A message is a reply to a previous one (e.g.: acknowledgments (\"thanks!\"), closures (\"it's working now\"), and answers (\"Yes I have made that change\") are merged into the previous request.\n\n  * Messages by different users in rapid succession where they have tagged each other (e.g.: U0: \"Hi @u1\"; U1: \"Hi there!\") are considered part of the same request\n\n##\n\nRequest Properties\n\nThe following are the default properties of each request.\n\n  1. **Author** \\- The individual who initiates the Slack message is the author of the request.\n\n  2. **Summary** \\- AI-generated title summary for each request\n\n  3. **Status** \\- Each request can have one of six different statuses: Open, In Progress, Pending, On Hold, Solved, or Closed.\n\n  4. **Assignee** \\- Responders who have been assigned the request\n\n  5. **Priority** \\- Priority of the request.\n\n  6. **Last Message Time** \\- The timestamp of the last message was received on a request\n\n  7. **Created Time** \\- The timestamp of when the request was created\n\nAll these properties can be browsed and edited from the collection dashboard\nand views.\n\nIf a request is converted to a ClearFeed Ticket, the ticket shares the same\nrequest properties.\n\n##\n\nRequest Statuses\n\nClearFeed supports six different statuses out of the box.\n\nStatus| Meaning  \n---|---  \nOpen| Pending resonse from responders  \nIn Progress| Has been responded by responders  \nPending| Pending response from author  \nSolved| Resolved, but can be re-opened by requester msgs  \nClosed| Resolved and can't be re-opened by requester msgs  \nOn Hold| Used when requests are converted to external tickets  \n  \nThere is no support for any custom statuses on ClearFeed yet.\n\nFollowing are the automatic status transitions supported on ClearFeed.\n\n  1. **Open** : \n\n     * When a new request is initiated by an author it has an `Open` status\n\n     * A request stays in `Open` status until there is a response from the responder\n\n     * If the request is in `In-Progress`, `Pending`, or `Solve` status, a reply from the requester or any non-responder on the same request moves the status to `Open`\n\n       * Our AI can distinguish messages that signal \"Thanks\" or closure acknowledgments and doesn't move the status in those cases to `Open`\n\n  2. **In Progress** : \n\n     * The request will move to `In Progress` status from `Open` status if there is a reply from the responder on the request\n\n     * If the [emoji rules](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/collections) are enabled for the collection and the responder adds an \ud83d\udc40 without any reply on the request thread, the status will move to `In Progress`\n\n  3. **Pending** : \n\n     * Once a request is manually moved to `Pending` by a responder - any further response to the request from responders will keep the status as `Pending.`\n\n  4. **On Hold** : \n\n     * If the request is converted to a Ticket using an integration (e.g. Zendesk), then the request will be moved to `On Hold` status\n\n     * In case of `On Hold` status, any response from the responder will not move the ClearFeed status to `Open`\n\n  5. **Solved** : \n\n     * If the [emoji rules](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/collections) are enabled for the collection and if the responder adds a check-mark emoji on the request thread in Slack, then the request status will be moved to `Solved`\n\n     * If a linked ticket to a request gets solved in the downstream system (e.g. Zendesk), \u2705 is applied on the request thread and it will move the status of the request to `Solved`\n\n  6. **Closed:**\n\n     * Once a request is moved to `Closed` , any message from the requester will not re-open the request and it will stay `Closed`\n\nEach request on the Triage channel and web dashboard has a corresponding color\nassociated with it based on the status.\n\nRequests status can be manually changed on ClearFeed through a variety of\nmethods:\n\n  * Using Emoji rules\n\n  * Using `Edit` button on the Triage channel\n\n  * From the ClearFeed Web app\n\nIf a request is not marked as Solved or Closed and a responder replies in the\nthread, the Status will automatically change to 'Pending.'\n\nThis feature may not be enabled for your account directly. Please contact us\nif you'd like to activate it.\n\nBelow is a short demonstration of how a request status is changed from the\nmethods mentioned:\n\n##\n\nRequest Priorities\n\nClearFeed Requests support four different priorities.\n\n  1. Urgent\n\n  2. High\n\n  3. Normal\n\n  4. Low\n\nRequest priority can be changed via the ClearFeed Web App or by using the\n`Edit` button on the Triage request message.\n\nHow does ClearFeed automatically assign priority to requests?\n\nClearFeed uses in-house AI systems to assign priority to requests, on the\nbasis of keywords used. By default, all requests are classified as `Normal`\npriority.\n\nIf any request is created by end-customer containing any of the keywords\nbelow, used in a positive sense, the request priority will automatically be\nupgraded to `High`. The default keywords are:\n\n  * critical\n\n  * as soon as possible\n\n  * asap\n\n  * p0\n\n  * p1\n\n  * urgent\n\n  * blocker \n\n  * important\n\n  * immediate help\n\n  * priority\n\n  * hipri\n\n  * emergency\n\n  * immediate \n\n  * immediately \n\n  * urgency\n\nOnly if these keywords are used in a positive sense will this request be\nclassified as a `High` priority. Please note that these keywords have to be\nused by a non-responder in any message in a request thread to automatically\nclassify the request as `High` priority.\n\nFor Example: The request containing the text `This is not an urgent bug` will\n**not** be considered as `High` priority but, the request containing the text\n`This is an urgent bug` will be considered as a `High` priority.\n\nThese are the default keywords included, please contact us either via your\nSlack channel with ClearFeed or via **support@clearfeed.ai** to add keywords\ncustomized for your workflow.\n\n##\n\nFAQs\n\n####\n\nWhy are my messages merged into a single request/ticket?\n\nFor external support use cases, we have a Collection level setting that merges\nconsecutive direct messages on a channel by the same author if these messages\nare made within 5 minutes.\n\nThis is done to ensure unthreaded replies are also captured in the request. If\nyou want to reduce this interval or turn it off (by setting it to 0) - you can\ndo so by going to [Advanced Collection Settings](/clearfeed-help-\ncenter/account-setup/collections#advanced-collection-level-settings) and\nchanging the interval for the setting -\n**CONSECUTIVE_MESSAGES_BY_SAME_AUTHOR_INTERVAL**(set to 5 minutes by default\nfor customer support use cases).\n\n####\n\nWhy are multiple messages on a channel by the same author not being merged\ninto a single ticket?\n\nFor Internal use cases, we treat each direct message on a channel as a new\nrequest - that in turn creates a fresh ticket. You can however merge these\ndirect messages into a single ticket by specifying an interval in which these\nmessages are sent.\n\nIf you want to increase this interval - you can do so by going to [Advanced\nCollection Settings](/clearfeed-help-center/account-\nsetup/collections#advanced-collection-level-settings) and changing the\ninterval for the setting -\n**CONSECUTIVE_MESSAGES_BY_SAME_AUTHOR_INTERVAL**(set to 0 minutes by default\nfor Internal support use cases).\n\n[PreviousClearFeed Slack App](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-\nrequests/clearfeed-slack-app)[NextTickets](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-\nhelpdesk/clearfeed-ticketing)\n\nLast updated 21 days ago\n\n"

        "title": "Internal Helpdesk",
        "text": "# Internal Helpdesk\n\n  1. **What is the billing unit for Internal Helpdesks?**\n\nInternal Helpdesks are priced based on the number of agents added to your\naccount. Admins control the settings on which users are configured as agents.\n\n  1. **Who is considered an agent on ClearFeed?**\n\nAn agent is a Slack user who can assign requests to themselves or other agents\non ClearFeed. They are generally members of the team who respond to user\ntickets and need to manage their workflow and reporting via our helpdesk.\n\nYou can add users to ClearFeed from the Users section in your account settings\nand configure which of them will be agents.\n\n  1. **If I am an agent on multiple accounts on the same ClearFeed parent account, will I be only counted once or many times?**\n\nYes, you will only counted as an agent once for billing purposes.\n\n  1. **Can non-agents participate in ticketing without paying for the agent license?**\n\nYes, they can respond to employee tickets on Slack and be a part of the\nrequest and triage channels on Slack. They can also review all tickets on the\nClearFeed dashboard. However, they will not be able to assign tickets to\nthemselves or other agents or publicly be able to respond to messages from the\ntriage channel.\n\n  1. **What a non-agent cannot do?**\n\nNon-agent can't assign any request to themselves or any other Slack User.\nAdditionally, they can\u2019t do a public response to requests/tickets from the\ntriage channel.\n\n  1. **Does pricing depend on the number of Slack users raising tickets?**\n\nNo there are no restrictions on the number of users. Any member of your Slack\nworkspace can create a ticket on ClearFeed. However, a Slack user cannot\nassign any ticket to themselves or any other Slack users\n\n  1. **Does pricing depend on the number of members of the triage channel?**\n\nNo, you can add any number of members to the triage channel on ClearFeed. You\nonly need to pay for the number of agents who can own a request.\n\n  1. **Does pricing depend on the number of members who have access to the web application?**\n\nNo, you can add any number of members to the ClearFeed web app without paying\nfor them, as long as they are not users.\n\n  1. **Can I create an unlimited number of tickets with a single-agent license?**\n\nEach agent license can only cater to a maximum of 200 tickets/month. However,\nthis limit multiplies as the number of agents' licenses increases. For\nexample, if you have signed up for 3 agent licenses, then your agents can\ncollectively create up to 600 tickets per month.\n\n  1. **What is the additional pricing beyond 200 tickets/agent/month?**\n\nThere is a capacity of 200 tickets/agent/month allocated against every agent.\nIf you exceed that capacity, you will charged for the additional usage.\n\nFor example, if you have signed up for 3 agents and the number of monthly\ntickets exceeds 600 tickets for the month, you will charged for an extra agent\nfor each pack of 200 additional tickets. For example, in the case of 850\ntickets and 3 agents, you will charged for 5 agents for the month.\n\n  1. **How to determine the number of agent licenses required by me?**\n\nAs best practices, we recommend you purchase licenses equal to the total of\nthe strength of your Customer Support/Success teams and managers if any.\n\n  1. **What type of billing plans does ClearFeed support?**\n\nWe support both monthly billing plans as well as annual billing for upfront\npurchases at a discount (15%). The pricing for the starter and professional\nplans are shared on the [pricing page](https://clearfeed.ai/pricing#Internal-\nHelpdesk). For the enterprise package, you should write to sales@clearfeed.ai\nor set up a demo on the website.\n\n  1. **My pricing structure is different from the pricing shared on the website. Are there any exceptions to this?**\n\nYes, you may have custom pricing shared with you by the sales team for the\nEnterprise Package. You can write to us if you need to clarify your pricing at\n[sales@clearfeed.ai](mailto:sales@clearfeed.ai)\n\n  1. **How do you calculate agents in a given month?**\n\nYou will charged based on max number of agents at any point in time over one\nmonth. We only consider a user an agent if they are configured as an agent for\nat least 2 days and not removed.\n\n  1. **How does ClearFeed do annual billing?**\n\nTo avail of the annual discount (e.g., 15%), you must pay for the upfront\npurchase of ClearFeed Agents Licences at the beginning of the contract period.\nYou will be charged once for a contract duration of 1 year based on your\nselected plan. Right now, we don\u2019t support billing orchestration within the\nproduct. We will send you a Stripe link for payment and our preferred payment\nmethod is using a credit card.\n\n  1. **How are monthly overages calculated for the annual plan?**\n\nFor the annual plan, for any additional utilization on top of yearly licenses\npurchased, we charge you based on actuals without discounts as overages for\nthat particular month.\n\nFor example, You purchased 10 Licenses of Professional plan for 1 year. You\nwill be charged for 10 agents with Annual discounts at the beginning of the\nContract. Within that year, in any given month you utilized more than 10\nagents licensed (say 12), then you will be charged for 2 additional seats as\noverage without a discount for that month.\n\n  1. **How does ClearFeed do billing for monthly subscriptions?**\n\nWith ClearFeed, you need to pre-purchase the number of agent licenses you plan\nto use in any given month. For the first month, we will bill you based on the\nnumber of agents at the start of the month.\n\nFor every month of usage, we determine the number of additional ClearFeed\nAgents licenses you have used beyond the capacity already purchased and charge\nthe monthly overage fees as per the plan that you are on. Moreover, for\nsubsequent months; you will be billed for a month assuming your license usage\nwill remain the same as the previous month. If the actual usage exceeds or\nfalls short of the projected usage, the charges will be adjusted in the next\nbilling cycle based on the difference in usage.\n\n  1. **What if I remove an agent in the middle of a billing cycle?**\n\nIf you remove an agent, it will not affect the current billing cycle. However,\nin the next billing cycle, we will consider the starting agent licenses by\nexcluding the removed agents.\n\n  1. **For an Annual Plan, will there be adjustments provided if the total usage is less than the total agent licenses purchased for the year?**\n\nThe minimal service fee applicable will be based on the number of agent\nlicenses purchased for the year. If you use less than that, there will be no\nadjustments provided in the next month based on the same.\n\n  1. **How is a billing month considered?**\n\nIf you start on the paid plan of ClearFeed on 31st March, then the first\nbilling month is considered from 1st April to 30th April. Subsequent billing\nmonths are considered in increments of calendar months.\n\n  1. **What if I want to cancel the plan in the middle of a billing cycle?**\n\nThis is only possible to do for the monthly subscription plan. If you\nunsubscribe in the middle of the month, we will not charge you for the next\ncalendar month and your contract will end at the end of the current calendar\nmonth. To do this you will have to write to us on\n[support@clearfeed.ai](mailto:support@clearfeed.ai)\n\n[PreviousExternal Helpdesk](/clearfeed-help-center/pricing-and-\nbilling/billing/external-helpdesk)[NextIntegrations](/clearfeed-help-\ncenter/pricing-and-billing/billing/integrations)\n\nLast updated 7 months ago\n\n"

Please make sure you have the required authorization.\n\n  * Once your Atlassian account is integrated with ClearFeed, your Jira projects will be accessible without any additional steps.\n\n  * On the ClearFeed web app, navigate to the `Settings` from the nav-bar, and then open the [Integrations](https://web.clearfeed.app/settings/integrations) section.\n\n  * Click the **Connect** button next to Atlassian, sign in with your credentials, and you'll be taken to the Atlassian marketplace.\n\n  * Search for ClearFeed by clicking **Find new apps** , then click on the ClearFeed card in the search results.\n\n  * Click **Get App** and confirm by selecting **Get it now** to add ClearFeed to your Atlassian account. A success message will appear at the bottom right.\n\n  * Click **Configure** from the success toast or go to **Manage app** > **User-installed apps** > **Configure**.\n\n  * After signing in to ClearFeed, click **Finish installation** to complete the process and connect your Atlassian account.\n\n##\n\nEnable Ticketing\n\n  1. On the ClearFeed web application, open the Collection where you want to enable Ticketing\n\n  2. Click on `Settings` tab, and expand the `Ticketing Settings` section.\n\n  3. Enable the toggle, and choose the `JSM` as the `Ticketing Integration`.\n\n  4. Choose the Trigger Mode: **Emoji**(Manual) or **Automatic**\n\n     * **Emoji:** Create tickets when the configured emoji is used on a message.\n\n     * **Automatic:** Create tickets for all new messages on a channel.\n\n  5. Click the \u2699\ufe0f icon to open the JSM setup modal. Here, select the default JSM project and issue type. Click on Save.\n\n##\n\nFunctionalities\n\n  * Replies on the Slack thread and the JSM ticket are synced bidirectionally.\n\n  * The corresponding request channel thread on Slack now displays the Title, ID, URL, and Status of the JSM Ticket.\n\n  * Status changes from JSM are reflected on Slack.\n\n  * ClearFeed adds the following labels to the JSM ticket: slack-channel-name, clearfeed.\n\n  * Public comments from the triage channel are also synced back to the JSM ticket.\n\n  * Status change updates are posted on the thread when the JSM ticket is moved to Solved status.\n\n##\n\nSync Settings\n\nSync settings allow you to choose whether messages are synced bidirectionally\nor in a single direction. Additionally, you can decide if updates to the\nlinked ticket's status are shared in the Slack thread.\n\n###\n\nFor all Tickets\n\nTo configure common sync settings for all new tickets - follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n  1. Access Sync Settings by navigating to [**Objects**](https://web.clearfeed.app/objects/jsm)\n\n  2. Choose your **Message Sync Mode**\n\n  3. Select whether status updates are shared in the **Status Sync Mode** setting\n\n###\n\nFor Individual Tickets\n\nYou can also configure different sync settings for individual tickets. Once a\nticket is created from Slack, access the three-dot menu (shown in the\nillustration below) and configure your settings.\n\nOnly Responders can configure Sync Settings for individual tickets from the\nrequest channel in Slack\n\n###\n\nMessage Sync Mode\n\nDetermines how messages are synced between Slack and JSM.\n\n  * **2-way sync between JSM and Slack thread:** Replies from Slack are posted on JSM, and comments from JSM are synced to Slack.\n\n  * **Only forward sync from Slack thread to JSM:** Replies from Slack are posted on JSM, but comments from JSM are not posted back on Slack.\n\n  * **Only backward sync from JSM to Slack thread:** Only JSM comments are posted on Slack, and replies from Slack do not go to JSM.\n\n  * **No sync between JSM and Slack thread:** No comments are synced from Slack or JSM.\n\n###\n\nStatus Sync Mode\n\nDetermine whether status updates are shared on the request channel thread on\nSlack or not.\n\nUpdates are only delivered when the status is changed to \"Solved\" or moved to\n\"Open\" from \"Solved\"\n\n  * **Sync key status changes from JSM to Slack thread:** Whenever the ticket is \"Solved\" or moved to \"Open\" from \"Solved - the updates are shared on Slack.\n\n  * **No sync of status changes from JSM to the Slack thread:** No status updates are synced to Slack.\n\n[PreviousForms](/clearfeed-help-\ncenter/integrations/hubspot/forms)[NextJira](/clearfeed-help-\ncenter/integrations/jira)\n\nLast updated 1 month ago\n\n"

Tag the users using the @\nsymbol. Use _all_ to get requests irrespective of their assignee. Use _empty_\nto get requests that are unassigned. Defaults to requests assigned to you.\n**\\--status** \u2014 Filter by request statuses. Allowed values are _open_ ,\n_in_progress_ , _closed,_ and _on_hold_. Use _all_ to get requests\nirrespective of their status. Defaults to requests which are open and in\nprogress. **\\--channel** \u2014 If the command is run in a triage channel, an\nadditional filter over the channels for which the triage channel is set up can\nbe applied. Tag the channels using the # symbol. Defaults to all channels\nbelonging to the triage channel. **\\--duration** \u2014 Duration within which the\nrequests have been raised. Positive and negative values represent _newer than_\nor _older than_ respectively. For example, `--duration 7` means requests newer\nthan 7 days and `--duration -7` means requests older than 7 days. Defaults to\nrequests newer than 30 days. **\\--start** \u2014 Filter by start date. For example,\n`--start 2023-01-15` means requests newer than the start of 15th Jan 2023.\n**\\--end** \u2014 Filter by end date. For example, `--end '15 Jan 2023'` means\nrequests older than the end of 15th Jan 2023. **\\--type** \u2014 Filter by request\ntypes. Allowed values are _all_ , _with-tickets_.

But you can get in touch with us\nat support@clearfeed.ai or our shared Slack channel and we can share with you\na script using which you will be able to add ClearFeed to a list of public\nSlack channels.\n\n  1. **Is it possible to bulk-add private channels into a Collection?**\n\nAnswer: It is not possible to bulk-add private channels as apps with bot\nprivileges (like ClearFeed) cannot list private channels in Slack. You have to\nmanually invite ClearFeed to private channels individually by running `/invite\n@Clearfeed`.\n\n  1. **How can I invite the Clearfeed bot to a shared Slack channel if I don't have permission?**\n\nAnswer: If you are in a shared Slack channel where your customer owns the\nchannel and has not granted you permission to invite users, they will have to\ntemporarily grant you permission to invite apps.

Click on `Refresh Status` after a few minutes to see the updated status.\n\n  2. **Indexing** : Currently being processed for indexing. Click on `Refresh Status` after a few minutes to see the updated status.\n\n  3. **Indexed** : Ready to use for generating answers, with indexing being completed.\n\n  4. **Failed** : Indexing was not successful.

        "text": "**Key functionalities of the triage channel for External Helpdesk**\n\n  * Serves as a single source of truth for consolidating requests from all customer channels. \n\n  * Allows responders to respond to customer queries and edit request properties.\n\n  * Facilitates internal communication between responders and allows sharing the request to an engineering integration such as Jira, GitHub, Linear, etc...\n\n**Note:** All responses to the request thread on the Triage will be propagated\nand posted on the same thread in the request channel.\n\n  * All requests from request channels in a Collection will be propagated to their corresponding Triage.\n\n  * If you are working predominantly from triage channels, we suggest you [mute all request channels](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages) (and preferably leave those channels)\n\n###\n\nTriage channel\n\nWhenever a customer starts a new conversation in a customer channel, it will\nbe synced into the triage channel as shown below:\n\n  * You can reply in the triage channel thread, and the responses will be synced to the customer channel. \n\n  * `Edit` button allows you to manage the request's _Assignee_ , _Status_ , _Priority_ , and _custom fields_ (if any).\n\n  * Clicking on `view in #channel` takes you to the customer channel where the request was started.\n\n  * Use [**Not a request**](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels/for-external-helpdesk#marking-a-request-as-not-a-request) to mark the conversation as not a request and optionally, remove it from the triage channel. \n\n  * Use [**internal comments**](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels/for-external-helpdesk#internal-comments) (prefix messages with \ud83d\udd12emoji) to collaborate internally. \n\n  * Use [**More Actions**](/clearfeed-help-center/manage-requests/triage-channels/for-external-helpdesk#triage-more-actions) for filing a task to an external tool like Jira, GitHub, Linear, etc...\n\n  * `Mark as Solved` allows you to resolve the request. \n\n    * `Mark as Closed` allows you to permanently close the request. \n\n##\n\nTriage Properties\n\n###\n\nNot a Request\n\nMarking a request as `Not a request`\n\nClearFeed allows marking conversations as \"Not a Request\" to exclude them from\nreports and SLAs.\n\n  * This can be done for Open/Pending requests with a dedicated button or via \"More Actions\" for In-progress/On-hold ones.\n\n  * Clicking \"Not a Request\" offers two options:\n\n    * **Remove** : Deletes the conversation entirely.\n\n    * **Archive** : Hides the conversation but reopens on further messages.\n\n**Note:** When responder messages exist in the triage channel, using\n**Remove** marks the message as \"Not a Request\" instead of deleting it.\nFollow-up messages from the requester will not reopen the request.\n\n###\n\nInternal Comments\n\nUsing Internal Comments on the triage channel\n\n  * ClearFeed allows private conversations with your team members on requests using the \ud83d\udd12emoji. \n\n  * Messages (and any attachments) with the \ud83d\udd12 stay hidden from the customer.\n\n###\n\nTriage More Actions\n\nEnable responders on the triage channel to convert requests to tickets or link\ntasks in downstream task management systems with `More actions`.\n\nClicking **More Actions** shows the customer's email and the ClearFeed\nCollection to which the channel belongs at the bottom.\n\nFile a ticket and establish a two-way sync\n\n  * If you use Freshdesk, Salesforce, Zendesk, Hubspot, or JSM for ticketing, convert Slack requests to tickets with the \"File a ticket\" option in \"More Actions.\"\n\n  * All responses and attachments flow smoothly between Slack and your ticketing system.\n\n  * Agent responses from the triage channel are visible in both the request channel and the external ticketing system.\n\n  * Your team can continue working on requests in the triage channel even after converting them to tickets.\n\nFile tasks or link existing tasks from engineering integrations\n\n  * Use ClearFeed to create tasks in engineering systems (like Jira, GitHub, and Linear) and link them to requests for better tracking.\n\n  * Comments from the triage channel thread are synced into the linked task for better visibility. \n\n  * ClearFeed can automatically update the triage channel thread when the linked tasks are completed in the engineering system.\n\n"
